Investing.com - Market watchers will be looking ahead to a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping this week amid hopes for a thaw in trade relations, even if it alters expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.

A line-up of Fed speakers, as well as fresh economic data and earnings will also command investors’ attention. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

1. G20 Meeting

Trump announced last week that he would hold an “extended meeting” with Xi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan. The two-day summit gets underway on Friday.

Negotiations between Washington and Beijing broke down in early May after Trump accused China of retreating from previous commitments, causing a market sell-off.

Trump then slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatened to impose tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods, a scenario that Goldman Sachs says could sink equity markets as much as 4%.

""The best the market can expect out of the G20 is a handshake and a commitment to resume talking,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri.

This could be enough to pep up the trade-weary market while anything less could cause the market to nosedive.

2. Fed Speakers

Appearances this week by several Fed policymakers will be closely watched after the U.S. central bank indicated last week that it could cut interest rates to offset global economic uncertainties and subdued inflation.

Fed Chairman will discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, in New York on Tuesday.

New York Fed head John Williams and St Louis Fed President James Bullard are both due to speak the same day. Bullard the Fed’s decision to keep rates on hold last week, instead favoring a quarter percentage point rate cut.

One uncertainty investors face is whether positive Trump-Xi talks could delay a Fed rate cut.

U.S. economic growth, while slowing, is strong enough that ""the Fed can afford to wait a while"" to monitor trade-talk progress, Wells Fargo's Christopher said.

But if investors have to weigh a trade de-escalation with the possibility of fewer-than-hoped-for rate cuts, they will likely recognize ""that a trade deal is a more powerful boost to U.S. growth than Fed cuts,"" said Manulife's Donald.

3. U.S. Economic Data

Some key U.S. economic reports this week include the release of data on Wednesday along with figures on international trade.

Investors will also get an update on the health of the U.S. housing market from reports on , and the .

The week will also bring the final reading on first-quarter gross domestic product, with the consensus forecast for an unrevised reading of .

4. Euro Zone Inflation

Friday’s euro zone will tell whether European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was right to warn that more monetary easing would come unless prices started rising faster.

Inflation has undershot the ECB's near 2% target since 2013. The rate was 1.2% in May. The bank is worried, but it is a dilemma shared by policymakers in many countries, not least the U.S. and Japan.

But Draghi's words have made a mark. A closely-tracked key market inflation gauge -- the five-year, five-year break even forward -- has shot up to 1.3%, having languished at record lows at around 1.12% ahead of Tuesday's speech.

Economists say ""real economy"" indicators, wages, for instance, paint a less pessimistic inflation outlook, raising questions about whether Draghi's reaction to market-based inflation measures is warranted.

5. Earnings to Watch

Homebuilder Lennar (NYSE: ) is due to report before the open on Tuesday, while KB Home (NYSE: ) is set to release its earnings report a day later.

The world’s largest package shipment company, FedEx (NYSE: ) will report Q4 earnings after the close on Tuesday, amid concerns about its business being hit by the lingering China-U.S. trade dispute and slowing global growth.

On Thursday, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: ) is set to report ahead of the open, while sportswear powerhouse Nike (NYSE: ) will report after the close.

Constellation Brands (NYSE: ), the brewer of popular beer brand Corona, is set to report on Friday before the market open.

By Kevin Yao and Ben Blanchard

BEIJING (Reuters) - Both China and the United States should make compromises in trade talks, Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said on Monday, ahead of a much anticipated meeting between the Chinese and U.S. presidents at this week's G20 summit in Japan.

China and the United States last week said they were reviving talks ahead of the meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. Hopes that it will lead to a de-escalation of a trade war that is damaging the global economy has cheered financial markets.

Talks to reach a broad deal broke down last month after U.S. officials accused China of backing away from previously agreed commitments.

Speaking at a news briefing on the G20 summit, Wang, who is also part of the trade negotiating team with the United States, said talks between the two countries' trade teams were underway, though he gave no details.

China's principles are clear, he said - mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and meeting each other halfway.

""Mutual respect means each side must respect the other's sovereignty,"" Wang said.

""Equality and mutual benefit means the consultations have to happen on an equal basis, the agreement to be reached has to be beneficial for both sides,"" he said.

""Meeting each other half way means both sides have to compromise and make concessions, not just one side.""

Wang declined to answer a question about what specific compromises Xi may offer to win a trade deal with Trump.

Both the Chinese and U.S. teams are making preparations for the Xi-Trump meeting, Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Jun told the same briefing, again without offering details.

The two countries are in the middle of a costly trade dispute and have slapped increasingly severe tariffs on each other's imports. China has vowed to not give in on issues of principle nor under U.S. pressure.

Trump has threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion of goods, covering nearly all the remaining Chinese imports into the United States, including consumer products such as cellphones, computers and clothing.

RISING ECONOMIC RISKS

Wang said rising protectionism has dampened global trade and posed a threat to the global economy, while Chen Yulu, a vice governor of China's central bank, warned that global economic and financial risks are rising significantly.

""Signs of reversing monetary policy in major developed countries are becoming more evident,"" Chen told the same briefing.

""At the same time, policy room of many countries after the crisis has been reduced and room for coping with a sharp economic slowdown is limited.""

Last week, the Federal Reserve signaled interest rate cuts beginning as early as July to cope with growing economic risks, which analysts say could increase pressure on China's central bank to ease policy to support the slowing economy.

Another problem is U.S. sanctions on Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co Inc.

Wang said that Xi, when speaking by telephone to Trump last week, had said he hopes the United States can fairly treat Chinese companies.

""We hope that the U.S. can remove certain unilateral measures inappropriately taken against Chinese companies, in the spirit of free trade and the World Trade Organization.""

The Trump administration has accused China of failing to protect intellectual property rights, forced technology transfers and of failing to provide a level playing field for U.S. companies.

China has repeatedly promised to open its market wider to foreign investors and provide them with better services and treatment. China has also denied accusations of failing to protect intellectual property rights or of forcing foreign companies to transfer technology."

By Barani Krishnan

Investing.com - One week ago, we were talking about an Iranian attack on oil tankers. This week’s conversation was dominated by Iran’s downing of a U.S. drone and how President Donald Trump almost retaliated, before standing down in the final minutes. It wouldn’t be too surprising if next week brings another provocative Iran attack of some kind to push the president's button again.

As Olivier Jakob, founder of Swiss energy consultancy PetroMatrix, commented wryly on Friday: “In view of the 2020 elections, President Trump is facing a formidable challenge to address the military provocations of Iran, while avoiding a spike in gasoline prices and a correction of the stock market.”

Trump spoke of “major additional sanctions” against Iran on Saturday, before being holed up at Camp David, to plan his next move against the Islamic Republic. Last week’s 9% jump in U.S. was its biggest since Nov. 2016. 5% weekly gain was the most since the week ended Feb. 15.

On the precious metals front, bullion and futures of gold breached the magical $1,400 mark, hitting near six-year highs. With $1,500 being touted as the next target of gold bugs, some wonder if the yellow metal is better positioned than oil to benefit from the war cries in the Middle East -- as well as the Federal Reserve’s widely-expected rate cut.

Energy Review

There was no weekend short-covering for Iranian risk in the previous week despite the attack on the oil tankers. After this week though, we can't be sure that risk traders can ignore Iran anymore.

The FAA has ordered U.S. airlines to stay clear of the skies of Iran and it is likely that others will follow suit. Military escalation is a weekend risk.

As Jakob of PetroMatrix noted, the U.S. president first called out Iran on making a ""very big mistake” on the drone strike, before pinning blame on an Iranian general ""who was loose and stupid”. ""Trump clearly does not want to engage in a Middle-East war, but it will be harder and harder for the White House to leave the momentum to Iran without any U.S. response.""

Price wise, Brent's backwardation has eased further and WTI is almost out of contango despite high Cushing stocks. Gasoline has also seen strong support after a fire at the PES Philadelphia refinery.

Crude’s rally could extend into the coming week if the U.S. Energy Information Administration issues another strong dataset on crude stockpiles and gasoline demand like in the just-ended week.

Next week will be the final stretch before the July 1-2 meetings of OPEC and its key non-members’ alliance led by Russia. Typically, it is a time when OPEC ministers are most energetic in talking up oil prices. And the debate before them on extending production cuts by another six months will be rich for rhetoric.

Adding to that will be G20 in Osaka, where the star billing is Trump’s highly-anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Oil prices could also see another sharp upside if the U.S. president and his team hold, as he has promised, positive talks with China’s President Xi Jinping and negotiators from Beijing at the G20 meeting next weekend.

All these are hypothetical by the way, as a fall through in any could result in a fresh tumble in oil prices.

Precious Metals Review

Gold has been on an uptrend since the start of June, on speculation of a U.S. interest-rate cut. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve opened the door for a possible rate cut in the future, sending the yield on the benchmark Treasury note below 2% — a key psychological level — for the first time since November 2016.

Investing.com's sees a rate cut coming at the Fed's July 30-31 meeting.

Lower interest rates make safe-haven assets such as gold, which does not yield interest, more attractive while weighing on the U.S. dollar. In Friday’s session, the , measured against a basket of six currencies, hit a three-month low of 95.76.

“Should August gold climb and sustain above $1,420, my work will point to $1,445 to 1,450 as a minimum next target zone thereafter,” said Mike Paulenoff, gold commentator at MPTrader.com. “This will argue that its multi-year upside breakout will continue unabated, perhaps in reaction to the combination of an easier Fed, a weaker USD, rising inflationary expectations and heightened geopolitical tensions,” Paulenoff added.

, reflective of trades in bullion, peaked on Friday at $1,411.72, its highest since Sept. 2013. For the week, spot gold was up 4.4% while for the month, it showed a gain of 9.7%.

for August delivery, traded on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, settled Friday’s trade up $3.20, or 0.2%, at $1,400.10 per ounce. It earlier peaked at $1,414.95, its highest since Oct. 2013, when it rose to nearly $1,454. For the week, August gold was up 4.5%. For the month, it showed a gain of 10%.

Some are now talking of $1,500 levels and beyond if conflict in the Middle East reaches new heights after Thursday’s drone downing by Iran, and signs that the Fed could cut rates by 50 basis points or so by next month itself.

“$1,500 looks like the next big round target,” said Philip Streible, senior market strategist for precious metals at RJO Fututres in Chicago. “Of course, there’s a lot of stop losses out there that need to happen first.”

(Bloomberg) -- Hedge funds shorting stock volatility en masse is the latest canary in the coal mine for those fretting dovish central banks are setting the stage for the next market blow-up.

Not so fast, says a growing chorus of Wall Street voices.

As policy makers squeeze monetary uncertainty from asset prices, the fast money is betting against further swings in U.S. equities, according to futures data on the Cboe Volatility Index, or the . Net shorts are close to record highs.

But strategists are pushing back on fears that complacent traders are gripped in a speculative mania. They’re citing everything from the billions riding passive products tracking the long side of the wager to the smaller value of VIX shorts versus previous highs.

The positioning data overall paints a far “more nuanced” picture on the state of the volatility landscape, according to Bank of America Corp (NYSE: ).

“Discussions tend to miss the other side of the trade -- namely, the net long volatility exposure in VIX exchange-traded products, which now stands near an all-time high,” strategists including Anshul Gupta wrote in a note.

Just look at vega, or the sensitivity of options to changes in implied volatility. At $215 million, the long vega in ETPs is greater than the short vega of the VIX futures shorts at $164 million, according to Bank of America data.

In other words, sliced and diced this way, the longs are sizeable.

Meltdown Memories

And for those obsessed with hedge-fund shorts, it’s foolhardy to take net-positioning data at face value.

Volatility speculators typically hold a mix of long and shorts either as a hedge or a relative-value strategy, with U.S. positions often the funding leg of global trades.

“We don’t care so much about ‘net’ positioning so much as we care about how much short vol is out there that could be covered,” wrote Pravit Chintawongvanich, Wells Fargo’s equity derivatives strategist, in a note. “Short VIX futures positioning is actually smaller than the previous highs and the net position looks the way it does because long VIX futures positioning is down a lot.”

And it’s not even clear that investors in risk assets should fret too much about these signals from the volatility-derivatives market. While exchange-traded products that were short VIX futures arguably helped fuel February’s Volmageddon, their firepower has been considerably depleted.

“We look to debunk any myth that extreme short positioning in VIX leads to a spike in the VIX in the near-term, particularly given the dampened effect of volatility ETPs following the events of February 2018,” Maxwell Grinacoff, quantitative strategist at Macro Risk Advisors, said in a note.

He found no real statistical link between net positioning in VIX futures and the forward one-month performance of the , or the VIX itself.

That’s not to say futures speculation doesn’t matter.

In an equity sell-off, a feverish tug of war will break out between buyers of futures on the one hand and sellers on the other, pulling the contracts in opposite directions until an equilibrium emerges, according to the BofA strategists. All that will impact the VIX -- but outsized selling pressure is unlikely to spark a disruptive move.

As short ETPs are shadow of their former selves, large institutional sellers of volatility are more important players nowadays. These accounts have a higher pain threshold than the type of smaller retail players or leveraged funds that blew up in the first quarter of 2018.

Their presence was likely felt during the depths of the December equity sell-off when implied volatility was relatively cheap and skew, a cost measure for tail-risk protection, was suppressed. That all suggests the DNA of participants is just as important as the size of the short wagers.

“It is really a question of which side of the trade has the ‘weaker hand,’ i.e., is more reactive to risk as a vol spike unfolds,” the BofA strategists wrote."

By Ritvik Carvalho

LONDON (Reuters) - Global shares erased this week's gains on Thursday after weak manufacturing surveys from Asia and Europe stoked fears of a widespread slowdown in growth, adding to profit-taking ahead of the long Easter weekend.

French and German surveys of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector for April showed activity continuing to contract, hitting European stocks in early trade.

However, short-covering helped Germany's trade half a percent higher by afternoon in London and the pan-European index was higher 0.2 percent.

The euro fell to its lowest in over a week after the data, last down 0.3 percent on the day to $1.1253. [FRX/]

German 10-year bond yields were three basis points lower at minus 0.5 percent, dropping further off Wednesday's high of 0.10 percent.

Activity in Germany's services sector rose to a seven-month high in April, but investors focused on the 44.5 reading for the manufacturing sector, well below the 50.0 mark separating growth from contraction even if it was above the 44.1 reading last month.

""Overall, these prints confirm that Europe’s growth engine entered Q2 on a soft footing, and other things equal, they raise the likelihood that the ECB (European Central Bank) may roll out some more stimulus, or at least that any rate hike may be pushed further back,"" said Marios Hadjikyriacos, investment analyst at XM.

The weak surveys out of Europe added to a reading of Japanese manufacturing activity which showed new export orders fell at the fastest pace in almost three years.

MSCI's All Country World Index, which tracks stocks in 47 countries, was down 0.2 percent on the day. It erased all gains for the week after the German data.

The volatility index, also known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge"", inched up to 12.61, close to where it was at the start of the week. On Wednesday, the index had fallen to its lowest since August 2018.

E-mini futures for the were flat.

Market participants are also eyeing signs of progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations.

Washington and Beijing set a tentative timeline for a fresh round of face-to-face meetings ahead of a possible signing ceremony in late May or early June, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

The U.S. trade deficit fell to an eight-month low in February as imports from China plunged, data on Wednesday showed.

Separate figures from China earlier on Wednesday showed the world's second-largest economy grew at a steady 6.4 percent pace in the first quarter, defying forecasts for a slowdown.

Attention is now turning to how much more stimulus Beijing will apply without triggering more financial risks.

Elsewhere in currencies, the dollar was 0.3 percent higher against a basket of peers at 97.293.

The Australian dollar was 0.3 percent lower at $0.7157. It had earlier jumped to $0.7200 as traders wagered the Reserve Bank of Australia will not rush to ease rates even though the broader economy has seemingly lost momentum.

Oil prices rose slightly, boosted by a decline in U.S. inventories, ongoing supply cuts from OPEC and its allies, and U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran.

futures were 0.3 percent higher at $71.87 per barrel, while futures were also 0.3 percent higher at $63.97.

(Bloomberg) -- There is a complacency haunting foreign-exchange markets.

Measures of how much traders expect currencies to gyrate over the coming months have plunged amid apparent assurances from central banks that they aren’t going to create major waves with further policy normalization anytime soon. But some observers, including strategists at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) and Scotiabank are raising warning flags about the lack of volatility.

While the Federal Reserve has made clear that global risks warrant holding interest-rates steady, a rebound in growth in the second half of 2019 could well put increases back on the radar. Likewise, some warn against writing off entirely the prospect of additional normalization steps from the European Central Bank. Yet the situation being priced by the market is about as calm as it’s been in years. A JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: ). gauge of global currency swings on Thursday fell to around 6.2 percent, its lowest close since 2014 and down from more than 9.3 percent in January.

“As we start to move into the middle and second half of the year, markets will need to reassess their assumptions,” Jeremy Stretch, head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at CIBC in London, said on Bloomberg radio. “That may well bring forth a degree of volatility back into the market as investors are forced to reprice interest-rate cycles from the very benign scenarios they’ve been looking for.”

That lack of commotion has been evident not just in currencies, but has also been notable across asset classes. The Cboe Volatility Index -- a gauge of Wall Street stock-market movement more commonly known as the -- has tumbled by around two-thirds from the level it was at in late December. And in the U.S. government bond market, Bank of America Corp (NYSE: ).’s MOVE Index last month touched a record low.

Andrew Sheets, a strategist at Morgan Stanley, has warned that the current low turbulence environment can’t persist across asset classes, while John Normand, JPMorgan’s head of cross-asset fundamental strategy, called volatility “the least-loved market.”

“These multi-quarter undershoots are common during Fed pauses and typically require a rates rethink or geopolitical shock to revive,” Normand wrote in a note on Friday.

The shift in stance by major central banks in the past few months does give a better backdrop for risk assets, according to Scotiabank strategists Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret. But with liquidity low and complacency potentially edging higher, “a blow up in volatility is perhaps lurking around the corner,” they wrote in a note Monday."

(Bloomberg) -- A combination of low liquidity and high complacency mean cross-asset volatility won’t stay at historic lows for much longer, according to Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ).

“There are still two things that argue against the current levels of volatility being correct or sustainable,” cross-asset strategist Andrew Sheets said in an interview Friday. “The first is that market liquidity is still not great. The second: I’m not sure that the market in its newfound optimism has taken the story to the logical conclusion” about where asset prices are headed, he said.

Price swings in currencies, bonds and other asset classes have slumped amid a dovish shift from global central banks, increased economic stimulus from China, and easing trade tensions. The Cboe Volatility Index has fallen over 50 percent this year, and closed Friday at the lowest level in six months. Bank of America Corp (NYSE: ).’s MOVE Index, a gauge of volatility in Treasuries, is heading back toward its record low.

A disconnect between the growth in financial market size over the past decade and the capacity of banks to take on risk -- which hasn’t kept pace -- could exacerbate any selloffs, according to Sheets. Complacent market participants who equate a Federal Reserve on hold with low volatility is also an issue, and big price moves could soon surprise, he said.

“If the Fed stays dovish and the data weaken, volatility will go higher,” he said. “If the data pick up and central banks are effectively saying we’re not going to tighten in the face of improving data, wouldn’t that generate a lot more risk-taking behavior? And that would be volatile too.”

A number of strategists have also voiced concern over the impact of low liquidity. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: ).’s John Marshall and Rocky Fishman warned in December about the risks of falling volumes and market depth. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: ).’s Marko Kolanovic expressed concern this month about the negative feedback loop between volatility and liquidity.

Cautionary Tale

Investors may have gotten into the habit of selling volatility, which could be keeping some measures of it lower, according to Sheets. The strategist views 2007 as a cautionary tale for anyone who sees the world of low price swings as a time for complacency -- that year too you had a very flat yield curve and low implied volatility.

“The way the market explained that dynamic was, the Fed has stopped hiking and is now going to keep policy stable and will be for a while, and the economy’s a little soft,” he said. “That’s not how things transpired.”

Investing.com - Market watchers will be looking ahead to a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping this week amid hopes for a thaw in trade relations, even if it alters expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.

A line-up of Fed speakers, as well as fresh economic data and earnings will also command investors’ attention. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

1. G20 Meeting

Trump announced last week that he would hold an “extended meeting” with Xi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan. The two-day summit gets underway on Friday.

Negotiations between Washington and Beijing broke down in early May after Trump accused China of retreating from previous commitments, causing a market sell-off.

Trump then slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatened to impose tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods, a scenario that Goldman Sachs says could sink equity markets as much as 4%.

""The best the market can expect out of the G20 is a handshake and a commitment to resume talking,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri.

This could be enough to pep up the trade-weary market while anything less could cause the market to nosedive.

2. Fed Speakers

Appearances this week by several Fed policymakers will be closely watched after the U.S. central bank indicated last week that it could cut interest rates to offset global economic uncertainties and subdued inflation.

Fed Chairman will discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, in New York on Tuesday.

New York Fed head John Williams and St Louis Fed President James Bullard are both due to speak the same day. Bullard the Fed’s decision to keep rates on hold last week, instead favoring a quarter percentage point rate cut.

One uncertainty investors face is whether positive Trump-Xi talks could delay a Fed rate cut.

U.S. economic growth, while slowing, is strong enough that ""the Fed can afford to wait a while"" to monitor trade-talk progress, Wells Fargo's Christopher said.

But if investors have to weigh a trade de-escalation with the possibility of fewer-than-hoped-for rate cuts, they will likely recognize ""that a trade deal is a more powerful boost to U.S. growth than Fed cuts,"" said Manulife's Donald.

3. U.S. Economic Data

Some key U.S. economic reports this week include the release of data on Wednesday along with figures on international trade.

Investors will also get an update on the health of the U.S. housing market from reports on , and the .

The week will also bring the final reading on first-quarter gross domestic product, with the consensus forecast for an unrevised reading of .

4. Euro Zone Inflation

Friday’s euro zone will tell whether European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was right to warn that more monetary easing would come unless prices started rising faster.

Inflation has undershot the ECB's near 2% target since 2013. The rate was 1.2% in May. The bank is worried, but it is a dilemma shared by policymakers in many countries, not least the U.S. and Japan.

But Draghi's words have made a mark. A closely-tracked key market inflation gauge -- the five-year, five-year break even forward -- has shot up to 1.3%, having languished at record lows at around 1.12% ahead of Tuesday's speech.

Economists say ""real economy"" indicators, wages, for instance, paint a less pessimistic inflation outlook, raising questions about whether Draghi's reaction to market-based inflation measures is warranted.

5. Earnings to Watch

Homebuilder Lennar (NYSE: ) is due to report before the open on Tuesday, while KB Home (NYSE: ) is set to release its earnings report a day later.

The world’s largest package shipment company, FedEx (NYSE: ) will report Q4 earnings after the close on Tuesday, amid concerns about its business being hit by the lingering China-U.S. trade dispute and slowing global growth.

On Thursday, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: ) is set to report ahead of the open, while sportswear powerhouse Nike (NYSE: ) will report after the close.

Constellation Brands (NYSE: ), the brewer of popular beer brand Corona, is set to report on Friday before the market open.

By Kevin Yao and Ben Blanchard

BEIJING (Reuters) - Both China and the United States should make compromises in trade talks, Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said on Monday, ahead of a much anticipated meeting between the Chinese and U.S. presidents at this week's G20 summit in Japan.

China and the United States last week said they were reviving talks ahead of the meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. Hopes that it will lead to a de-escalation of a trade war that is damaging the global economy has cheered financial markets.

Talks to reach a broad deal broke down last month after U.S. officials accused China of backing away from previously agreed commitments.

Speaking at a news briefing on the G20 summit, Wang, who is also part of the trade negotiating team with the United States, said talks between the two countries' trade teams were underway, though he gave no details.

China's principles are clear, he said - mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and meeting each other halfway.

""Mutual respect means each side must respect the other's sovereignty,"" Wang said.

""Equality and mutual benefit means the consultations have to happen on an equal basis, the agreement to be reached has to be beneficial for both sides,"" he said.

""Meeting each other half way means both sides have to compromise and make concessions, not just one side.""

Wang declined to answer a question about what specific compromises Xi may offer to win a trade deal with Trump.

Both the Chinese and U.S. teams are making preparations for the Xi-Trump meeting, Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Jun told the same briefing, again without offering details.

The two countries are in the middle of a costly trade dispute and have slapped increasingly severe tariffs on each other's imports. China has vowed to not give in on issues of principle nor under U.S. pressure.

Trump has threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion of goods, covering nearly all the remaining Chinese imports into the United States, including consumer products such as cellphones, computers and clothing.

RISING ECONOMIC RISKS

Wang said rising protectionism has dampened global trade and posed a threat to the global economy, while Chen Yulu, a vice governor of China's central bank, warned that global economic and financial risks are rising significantly.

""Signs of reversing monetary policy in major developed countries are becoming more evident,"" Chen told the same briefing.

""At the same time, policy room of many countries after the crisis has been reduced and room for coping with a sharp economic slowdown is limited.""

Last week, the Federal Reserve signaled interest rate cuts beginning as early as July to cope with growing economic risks, which analysts say could increase pressure on China's central bank to ease policy to support the slowing economy.

Another problem is U.S. sanctions on Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co Inc.

Wang said that Xi, when speaking by telephone to Trump last week, had said he hopes the United States can fairly treat Chinese companies.

""We hope that the U.S. can remove certain unilateral measures inappropriately taken against Chinese companies, in the spirit of free trade and the World Trade Organization.""

The Trump administration has accused China of failing to protect intellectual property rights, forced technology transfers and of failing to provide a level playing field for U.S. companies.

China has repeatedly promised to open its market wider to foreign investors and provide them with better services and treatment. China has also denied accusations of failing to protect intellectual property rights or of forcing foreign companies to transfer technology."

By Barani Krishnan

Investing.com - One week ago, we were talking about an Iranian attack on oil tankers. This week’s conversation was dominated by Iran’s downing of a U.S. drone and how President Donald Trump almost retaliated, before standing down in the final minutes. It wouldn’t be too surprising if next week brings another provocative Iran attack of some kind to push the president's button again.

As Olivier Jakob, founder of Swiss energy consultancy PetroMatrix, commented wryly on Friday: “In view of the 2020 elections, President Trump is facing a formidable challenge to address the military provocations of Iran, while avoiding a spike in gasoline prices and a correction of the stock market.”

Trump spoke of “major additional sanctions” against Iran on Saturday, before being holed up at Camp David, to plan his next move against the Islamic Republic. Last week’s 9% jump in U.S. was its biggest since Nov. 2016. 5% weekly gain was the most since the week ended Feb. 15.

On the precious metals front, bullion and futures of gold breached the magical $1,400 mark, hitting near six-year highs. With $1,500 being touted as the next target of gold bugs, some wonder if the yellow metal is better positioned than oil to benefit from the war cries in the Middle East -- as well as the Federal Reserve’s widely-expected rate cut.

Energy Review

There was no weekend short-covering for Iranian risk in the previous week despite the attack on the oil tankers. After this week though, we can't be sure that risk traders can ignore Iran anymore.

The FAA has ordered U.S. airlines to stay clear of the skies of Iran and it is likely that others will follow suit. Military escalation is a weekend risk.

As Jakob of PetroMatrix noted, the U.S. president first called out Iran on making a ""very big mistake” on the drone strike, before pinning blame on an Iranian general ""who was loose and stupid”. ""Trump clearly does not want to engage in a Middle-East war, but it will be harder and harder for the White House to leave the momentum to Iran without any U.S. response.""

Price wise, Brent's backwardation has eased further and WTI is almost out of contango despite high Cushing stocks. Gasoline has also seen strong support after a fire at the PES Philadelphia refinery.

Crude’s rally could extend into the coming week if the U.S. Energy Information Administration issues another strong dataset on crude stockpiles and gasoline demand like in the just-ended week.

Next week will be the final stretch before the July 1-2 meetings of OPEC and its key non-members’ alliance led by Russia. Typically, it is a time when OPEC ministers are most energetic in talking up oil prices. And the debate before them on extending production cuts by another six months will be rich for rhetoric.

Adding to that will be G20 in Osaka, where the star billing is Trump’s highly-anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Oil prices could also see another sharp upside if the U.S. president and his team hold, as he has promised, positive talks with China’s President Xi Jinping and negotiators from Beijing at the G20 meeting next weekend.

All these are hypothetical by the way, as a fall through in any could result in a fresh tumble in oil prices.

Precious Metals Review

Gold has been on an uptrend since the start of June, on speculation of a U.S. interest-rate cut. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve opened the door for a possible rate cut in the future, sending the yield on the benchmark Treasury note below 2% — a key psychological level — for the first time since November 2016.

Investing.com's sees a rate cut coming at the Fed's July 30-31 meeting.

Lower interest rates make safe-haven assets such as gold, which does not yield interest, more attractive while weighing on the U.S. dollar. In Friday’s session, the , measured against a basket of six currencies, hit a three-month low of 95.76.

“Should August gold climb and sustain above $1,420, my work will point to $1,445 to 1,450 as a minimum next target zone thereafter,” said Mike Paulenoff, gold commentator at MPTrader.com. “This will argue that its multi-year upside breakout will continue unabated, perhaps in reaction to the combination of an easier Fed, a weaker USD, rising inflationary expectations and heightened geopolitical tensions,” Paulenoff added.

, reflective of trades in bullion, peaked on Friday at $1,411.72, its highest since Sept. 2013. For the week, spot gold was up 4.4% while for the month, it showed a gain of 9.7%.

for August delivery, traded on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, settled Friday’s trade up $3.20, or 0.2%, at $1,400.10 per ounce. It earlier peaked at $1,414.95, its highest since Oct. 2013, when it rose to nearly $1,454. For the week, August gold was up 4.5%. For the month, it showed a gain of 10%.

Some are now talking of $1,500 levels and beyond if conflict in the Middle East reaches new heights after Thursday’s drone downing by Iran, and signs that the Fed could cut rates by 50 basis points or so by next month itself.

“$1,500 looks like the next big round target,” said Philip Streible, senior market strategist for precious metals at RJO Fututres in Chicago. “Of course, there’s a lot of stop losses out there that need to happen first.”

Investing.com - U.S. futures pointed to a higher open on Friday as a volatile week saw stocks rally for a third straight day as they headed for the end of 2018.

The blue-chip gained 160 points, or 0.69%, to 23,312.50 points by 6:52 AM ET (11:52 GMT), the rose 17 points, or 0.69%, to 2,512.25 points, while the tech-heavy traded up 35 points, or 0.55%, to 6,358.38 points.

Although Wall Street began the week with the worst Christmas Eve selloff in its history, buyers quickly entered the market when doors reopened after the holiday with the Dow managing to lodge a record 1,000-point rally.

Thursday saw U.S. stocks start off on the back-foot only to stage their best reversal since 2010 to end in positive territory and the bullish vibe looked set to continue on the last day of the week.

""Selling pressure on U.S. equities is beginning to dissipate, but the is still around 29 with investor risk sentiment still recovering. A renewed market slide remains a risk,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo

But worries pervade as investors face 2019, with stocks still on track for their worst month of December since 1931 and both the and down more than 6% for all of 2018.

Concerns remain over political turmoil in Washington, unresolved trade issues between the U.S. and China, higher interest rates and a global economic slowdown.

“I think worries regarding the U.S. government shutdown as well as lack of clarity over whether the U.S.-Sino negotiations (over trade) will go well or not still remain,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.

The partial government shutdown entered its seventh day with markets looking ahead to Jan. 3 when Democrats take control of the U.S. House of Representatives.

As U.S. President Donald Trump grapples with Congress over $5 billion in funding for the southern border wall, Democratic chief Nancy Pelosi, incoming House speaker, promised that the chamber will pass a spending bill designed to reopen the government without funding for the border wall.

“We will vote swiftly to reopen government and show that Democrats will govern responsibly in stark contrast to this chaotic White House,” Pelosi said in a statement.

On the economic front, and due to the partial government shutdown, trade balance data and wholesale inventories that were originally scheduled for release Friday will not be published.

However, the for December is expected to be released at 9:45 AM ET (14:45 GMT), while the National Association of Realtors will publish November at 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT).

With regard to oil, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) will release its weekly report on at 11:00 AM ET (16:00 GMT), amid expectations for a stock draw of 2.9 million barrels. If confirmed, that would mark the fourth consecutive decline. U.S. crude inventories for the week to Dec. 21 rose by 6.9 million barrels to 448.2 million barrels on increased refinery output, according to data released on Thursday by industry group the American Petroleum Institute.

Also on the radar, Baker Hughes will release its weekly , an early indicator of future output, at 1:00 PM ET (18:00 GMT).

Ahead of the data, the , which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, was down 0.23% to 95.78 by 6:55 AM ET (11:55 GMT).

(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A year ago, when the market was rallying, President Donald Trump seemed sure stock prices were an accurate measure of his presidency. Now with the off more than 4,000 points from its peak, the president is not so sure about the market’s efficiency.

On Tuesday, President Trump said stocks were a good buy, effectively endorsing the notion, long held by many economists, that markets are inefficient. And given companies’ earnings, in Trump’s view, stocks have been oversold. “They have record kinds of numbers,” he said. “So I think it’s a tremendous opportunity to buy.”

If stocks overshot on the way up a year ago, which it seems clear they did, the question of whether the recent plunge has also been overdone is still uncertain. A day after the president’s comments that seemed to be the case. The market soared on Wednesday, with the rising 5 percent. Nonetheless, a volatile market, like the one recently, can itself create more volatility and feed a sell-off by sapping investor enthusiasm to own stocks, justifying their lower prices. What’s more, slumping stocks can slow the economy by making people less confident, creating a double whammy in bear markets, or nearly bear markets, like now.

In February, I wrote a column after the market’s first big plunge of the year that looked at some key factors to try to determine whether that earlier Trump Dump had gone too far. I found that it nearly had, and soon thereafter stocks rallied. The market is even lower now. Even after Wednesday’s gains, the S&P 500 is down 14 percent from its early October peak. So stocks should be even cheaper now? Not quite.

Earnings

One of the main things pushing stocks forward in the first year of Trump’s presidency, and propping them up until recently, was sharply climbing earnings, juiced by Trump’s tax cut. The bottom lines of the companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be up 24 percent for 2018. That’s not likely to be the case next year. Earnings will still be up, but only 8.4 percent, according to current projections. Investors, of course, given the one-time boost from the tax cut, which I estimate made up about 50 percent of the earnings growth this year, should have seen the drop coming. Still, it’s turning out to be steeper than expected. In early October, when the market peaked, analysts were looking for a 11.5 percent rise in profits next year at S&P 500 companies. Stocks typically trade at about 1.2 times their growth rate. So a 3 percent drop in expected growth means stocks should be down 4 percent from where they were in early October, based on earnings alone.

Profit Margins

The problem is that even that lower projection of earnings growth looks overly optimistic. That’s because it’s based on the assumption that profit margins not only remain stable but rise slightly next year from 12.1 percent to 12.4. That’s not likely to happen. Increasing interest rates, labor costs — fueled by a low unemployment rate — as well as higher input costs driven by rising tariffs are all likely to dent margins. If profit margins remain the same rather than rise slightly, then earnings growth will drop to about 5 percent, snipping an additional 4 percent off the stock market, or a total of 8 percent.

International Trade

A trade war puts even that earnings growth in jeopardy. The biggest problem is not next year, but long term. Over the past decade, the S&P 500 has had an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 15. That implies a long-term expected profit growth rate of about 12 percent. The S&P 500 gets about half of its sales from overseas, where those profits are rising much faster. A trade war won’t impact all of that growth. Assume a 50 percent chance that 50 percent of that growth is impacted, that brings your expected long-term growth rate down to 7.5 percent, and could imply that the S&P 500 should be worth an additional 5.5 percent less. So we are now at 13.5 percent.

Volatility

Here’s the big one. Volatility makes stock investors less interested in holding stocks. It also increases the risk of owning stocks in the future. Both of those things translate into a lower P/E ratio. How much? The , which measures stock market volatility, averaged 11 last year. This year the average has risen to nearly 17, though it has been about 35 recently. The VIX is measured in percentage points. So, all else being equal, a 6 percentage point higher VIX should translate into a stock market that is 6 percent lower.

Add it all up, and stock market values could have reasonably been expected to fall about 19.5 percent since mid-September. After Wednesday’s rally, they are 5 percent above that level. Like sell-offs, stock market rallies do feed on themselves. So stocks could continue to rise, but there is no reason to count on that. The stock market does not appear to be undervalued, and it certainly couldn’t be considered a “tremendous buy.” That also means that in this as in so many other things, Trump’s judgment is flawed."

That’s because it’s based on the assumption that profit margins not only remain stable but rise slightly next year from 12.1 percent to 12.4. That’s not likely to happen. Increasing interest rates, labor costs — fueled by a low unemployment rate — as well as higher input costs driven by rising tariffs are all likely to dent margins. If profit margins remain the same rather than rise slightly, then earnings growth will drop to about 5 percent, snipping an additional 4 percent off the stock market, or a total of 8 percent.

International Trade

A trade war puts even that earnings growth in jeopardy. The biggest problem is not next year, but long term. Over the past decade, the S&P 500 has had an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 15. That implies a long-term expected profit growth rate of about 12 percent. The S&P 500 gets about half of its sales from overseas, where those profits are rising much faster. A trade war won’t impact all of that growth. Assume a 50 percent chance that 50 percent of that growth is impacted, that brings your expected long-term growth rate down to 7.5 percent, and could imply that the S&P 500 should be worth an additional 5.5 percent less. So we are now at 13.5 percent.

Volatility

Here’s the big one. Volatility makes stock investors less interested in holding stocks. It also increases the risk of owning stocks in the future. Both of those things translate into a lower P/E ratio. How much? The , which measures stock market volatility, averaged 11 last year. This year the average has risen to nearly 17, though it has been about 35 recently. The VIX is measured in percentage points. So, all else being equal, a 6 percentage point higher VIX should translate into a stock market that is 6 percent lower.

Add it all up, and stock market values could have reasonably been expected to fall about 19.5 percent since mid-September. After Wednesday’s rally, they are 5 percent above that level. Like sell-offs, stock market rallies do feed on themselves. So stocks could continue to rise, but there is no reason to count on that. The stock market does not appear to be undervalued, and it certainly couldn’t be considered a “tremendous buy.” That also means that in this as in so many other things, Trump’s judgment is flawed."

Investing.com - Market watchers will be looking ahead to a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping this week amid hopes for a thaw in trade relations, even if it alters expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.

A line-up of Fed speakers, as well as fresh economic data and earnings will also command investors’ attention. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

1. G20 Meeting

Trump announced last week that he would hold an “extended meeting” with Xi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan. The two-day summit gets underway on Friday.

Negotiations between Washington and Beijing broke down in early May after Trump accused China of retreating from previous commitments, causing a market sell-off.

Trump then slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatened to impose tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods, a scenario that Goldman Sachs says could sink equity markets as much as 4%.

""The best the market can expect out of the G20 is a handshake and a commitment to resume talking,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri.

This could be enough to pep up the trade-weary market while anything less could cause the market to nosedive.

2. Fed Speakers

Appearances this week by several Fed policymakers will be closely watched after the U.S. central bank indicated last week that it could cut interest rates to offset global economic uncertainties and subdued inflation.

Fed Chairman will discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, in New York on Tuesday.

New York Fed head John Williams and St Louis Fed President James Bullard are both due to speak the same day. Bullard the Fed’s decision to keep rates on hold last week, instead favoring a quarter percentage point rate cut.

One uncertainty investors face is whether positive Trump-Xi talks could delay a Fed rate cut.

U.S. economic growth, while slowing, is strong enough that ""the Fed can afford to wait a while"" to monitor trade-talk progress, Wells Fargo's Christopher said.

But if investors have to weigh a trade de-escalation with the possibility of fewer-than-hoped-for rate cuts, they will likely recognize ""that a trade deal is a more powerful boost to U.S. growth than Fed cuts,"" said Manulife's Donald.

3. U.S. Economic Data

Some key U.S. economic reports this week include the release of data on Wednesday along with figures on international trade.

Investors will also get an update on the health of the U.S. housing market from reports on , and the .

The week will also bring the final reading on first-quarter gross domestic product, with the consensus forecast for an unrevised reading of .

4. Euro Zone Inflation

Friday’s euro zone will tell whether European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was right to warn that more monetary easing would come unless prices started rising faster.

Inflation has undershot the ECB's near 2% target since 2013. The rate was 1.2% in May. The bank is worried, but it is a dilemma shared by policymakers in many countries, not least the U.S. and Japan.

But Draghi's words have made a mark. A closely-tracked key market inflation gauge -- the five-year, five-year break even forward -- has shot up to 1.3%, having languished at record lows at around 1.12% ahead of Tuesday's speech.

Economists say ""real economy"" indicators, wages, for instance, paint a less pessimistic inflation outlook, raising questions about whether Draghi's reaction to market-based inflation measures is warranted.

5. Earnings to Watch

Homebuilder Lennar (NYSE: ) is due to report before the open on Tuesday, while KB Home (NYSE: ) is set to release its earnings report a day later.

The world’s largest package shipment company, FedEx (NYSE: ) will report Q4 earnings after the close on Tuesday, amid concerns about its business being hit by the lingering China-U.S. trade dispute and slowing global growth.

On Thursday, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: ) is set to report ahead of the open, while sportswear powerhouse Nike (NYSE: ) will report after the close.

Constellation Brands (NYSE: ), the brewer of popular beer brand Corona, is set to report on Friday before the market open.

By Kevin Yao and Ben Blanchard

BEIJING (Reuters) - Both China and the United States should make compromises in trade talks, Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said on Monday, ahead of a much anticipated meeting between the Chinese and U.S. presidents at this week's G20 summit in Japan.

China and the United States last week said they were reviving talks ahead of the meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. Hopes that it will lead to a de-escalation of a trade war that is damaging the global economy has cheered financial markets.

Talks to reach a broad deal broke down last month after U.S. officials accused China of backing away from previously agreed commitments.

Speaking at a news briefing on the G20 summit, Wang, who is also part of the trade negotiating team with the United States, said talks between the two countries' trade teams were underway, though he gave no details.

China's principles are clear, he said - mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and meeting each other halfway.

""Mutual respect means each side must respect the other's sovereignty,"" Wang said.

""Equality and mutual benefit means the consultations have to happen on an equal basis, the agreement to be reached has to be beneficial for both sides,"" he said.

""Meeting each other half way means both sides have to compromise and make concessions, not just one side.""

Wang declined to answer a question about what specific compromises Xi may offer to win a trade deal with Trump.

Both the Chinese and U.S. teams are making preparations for the Xi-Trump meeting, Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Jun told the same briefing, again without offering details.

The two countries are in the middle of a costly trade dispute and have slapped increasingly severe tariffs on each other's imports. China has vowed to not give in on issues of principle nor under U.S. pressure.

Trump has threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion of goods, covering nearly all the remaining Chinese imports into the United States, including consumer products such as cellphones, computers and clothing.

RISING ECONOMIC RISKS

Wang said rising protectionism has dampened global trade and posed a threat to the global economy, while Chen Yulu, a vice governor of China's central bank, warned that global economic and financial risks are rising significantly.

""Signs of reversing monetary policy in major developed countries are becoming more evident,"" Chen told the same briefing.

""At the same time, policy room of many countries after the crisis has been reduced and room for coping with a sharp economic slowdown is limited.""

Last week, the Federal Reserve signaled interest rate cuts beginning as early as July to cope with growing economic risks, which analysts say could increase pressure on China's central bank to ease policy to support the slowing economy.

Another problem is U.S. sanctions on Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co Inc.

Wang said that Xi, when speaking by telephone to Trump last week, had said he hopes the United States can fairly treat Chinese companies.

""We hope that the U.S. can remove certain unilateral measures inappropriately taken against Chinese companies, in the spirit of free trade and the World Trade Organization.""

The Trump administration has accused China of failing to protect intellectual property rights, forced technology transfers and of failing to provide a level playing field for U.S. companies.

China has repeatedly promised to open its market wider to foreign investors and provide them with better services and treatment. China has also denied accusations of failing to protect intellectual property rights or of forcing foreign companies to transfer technology."

Investing.com - One week ago, we were talking about an Iranian attack on oil tankers. This week’s conversation was dominated by Iran’s downing of a U.S. drone and how President Donald Trump almost retaliated, before standing down in the final minutes. It wouldn’t be too surprising if next week brings another provocative Iran attack of some kind to push the president's button again.

As Olivier Jakob, founder of Swiss energy consultancy PetroMatrix, commented wryly on Friday: “In view of the 2020 elections, President Trump is facing a formidable challenge to address the military provocations of Iran, while avoiding a spike in gasoline prices and a correction of the stock market.”

Trump spoke of “major additional sanctions” against Iran on Saturday, before being holed up at Camp David, to plan his next move against the Islamic Republic. Last week’s 9% jump in U.S. was its biggest since Nov. 2016. 5% weekly gain was the most since the week ended Feb. 15.

On the precious metals front, bullion and futures of gold breached the magical $1,400 mark, hitting near six-year highs. With $1,500 being touted as the next target of gold bugs, some wonder if the yellow metal is better positioned than oil to benefit from the war cries in the Middle East -- as well as the Federal Reserve’s widely-expected rate cut.

Energy Review

There was no weekend short-covering for Iranian risk in the previous week despite the attack on the oil tankers. After this week though, we can't be sure that risk traders can ignore Iran anymore.

The FAA has ordered U.S. airlines to stay clear of the skies of Iran and it is likely that others will follow suit. Military escalation is a weekend risk.

As Jakob of PetroMatrix noted, the U.S. president first called out Iran on making a ""very big mistake” on the drone strike, before pinning blame on an Iranian general ""who was loose and stupid”. ""Trump clearly does not want to engage in a Middle-East war, but it will be harder and harder for the White House to leave the momentum to Iran without any U.S. response.""

Price wise, Brent's backwardation has eased further and WTI is almost out of contango despite high Cushing stocks. Gasoline has also seen strong support after a fire at the PES Philadelphia refinery.

Crude’s rally could extend into the coming week if the U.S. Energy Information Administration issues another strong dataset on crude stockpiles and gasoline demand like in the just-ended week.

Next week will be the final stretch before the July 1-2 meetings of OPEC and its key non-members’ alliance led by Russia. Typically, it is a time when OPEC ministers are most energetic in talking up oil prices. And the debate before them on extending production cuts by another six months will be rich for rhetoric.

Adding to that will be G20 in Osaka, where the star billing is Trump’s highly-anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Oil prices could also see another sharp upside if the U.S. president and his team hold, as he has promised, positive talks with China’s President Xi Jinping and negotiators from Beijing at the G20 meeting next weekend.

All these are hypothetical by the way, as a fall through in any could result in a fresh tumble in oil prices.

Precious Metals Review

Gold has been on an uptrend since the start of June, on speculation of a U.S. interest-rate cut. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve opened the door for a possible rate cut in the future, sending the yield on the benchmark Treasury note below 2% — a key psychological level — for the first time since November 2016.

Investing.com's sees a rate cut coming at the Fed's July 30-31 meeting.

Lower interest rates make safe-haven assets such as gold, which does not yield interest, more attractive while weighing on the U.S. dollar. In Friday’s session, the , measured against a basket of six currencies, hit a three-month low of 95.76.

“Should August gold climb and sustain above $1,420, my work will point to $1,445 to 1,450 as a minimum next target zone thereafter,” said Mike Paulenoff, gold commentator at MPTrader.com. “This will argue that its multi-year upside breakout will continue unabated, perhaps in reaction to the combination of an easier Fed, a weaker USD, rising inflationary expectations and heightened geopolitical tensions,” Paulenoff added.

, reflective of trades in bullion, peaked on Friday at $1,411.72, its highest since Sept. 2013. For the week, spot gold was up 4.4% while for the month, it showed a gain of 9.7%.

for August delivery, traded on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, settled Friday’s trade up $3.20, or 0.2%, at $1,400.10 per ounce. It earlier peaked at $1,414.95, its highest since Oct. 2013, when it rose to nearly $1,454. For the week, August gold was up 4.5%. For the month, it showed a gain of 10%.

Some are now talking of $1,500 levels and beyond if conflict in the Middle East reaches new heights after Thursday’s drone downing by Iran, and signs that the Fed could cut rates by 50 basis points or so by next month itself.

“$1,500 looks like the next big round target,” said Philip Streible, senior market strategist for precious metals at RJO Fututres in Chicago. “Of course, there’s a lot of stop losses out there that need to happen first.”

By Medha Singh

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks tumbled on Friday, weighed down by rising Treasury yields after data showed job growth slowed in September, while wage increases were not enough to fan worries over rising inflation or faster interest rates hikes.

The losses were led by heavyweight stocks in the technology and communication services sectors, including the so-called FAANG group – Facebook (O: ), Amazon (O: ), Apple (O: ), Netflix (O: ) and Alphabet (O: ).

Apple fell 2.7 percent after David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital said it sold its remaining shares in the company on growing fear of ""Chinese retaliation against America's trade policies"".

Twitter (N: ) dropped 0.5 percent, giving up earlier gains after Greenlight also said it sold its entire stake in the company due to worries about regulatory risks affecting social media companies. Facebook (O: ) dropped 1.2 percent, while Snapchat-parent Snap (N: ) slid 1.7 percent.

That added to the pressure on the stock market from earlier in the session after the September jobs report.

Nonfarm payrolls increased less than expected in September, likely due to the effect of Hurricane Florence, though data for July and August was revised higher, a Labor Department report showed.

""Good news for economy is bad news for equity investors right now,"" said Michael Geraghty, equity strategist at Cornerstone Capital Group's in New York.

""The labor report on the surface looked a bit weak but once you got under the surface it kind of supported the story of a strong labor market.""

The report pushed longer-dated U.S. Treasury yields higher. That piled more pressure on U.S. stocks, which are trading near record-high levels, raising concerns about valuations with the earnings season just around the corner.

The technology sector ( ) sank 2 percent, dropping for the second day in a row as it also took a hit from a fall in shares of Intel (O: ) and Microsoft (O: ).

The communication services sector ( ), which houses Netflix, Facebook and Alphabet, dropped 1.5 percent.

At 13:18 EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) was down 276.53 points, or 1.04 percent, at 26,350.95, the S&P 500 ( ) was down 27.89 points, or 0.96 percent, at 2,873.72.

The Nasdaq Composite ( ) was down 146.44 points, or 1.86 percent, at 7,733.07, its lowest since mid August.

The CBOE Volatility index ( ), a gauge of investor anxiety, rose 2.48 points, climbing for the second day.

The only gainers among the 11 major S&P sectors were defensive utilities ( ), which advanced 1.5 percent and real estate up 0.4 percent.

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) was down 7 percent after CEO Elon Musk stirred nerves about the settlement of his securities fraud lawsuit by mocking the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Twitter. Greenlight's David Einhorn said his Tesla short was the second biggest winner last quarter.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.90-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 3.43-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded nine new 52-week highs and 22 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 15 new highs and 107 new lows."

Investing.com - Market watchers will be looking ahead to a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping this week amid hopes for a thaw in trade relations, even if it alters expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.

A line-up of Fed speakers, as well as fresh economic data and earnings will also command investors’ attention. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

1. G20 Meeting

Trump announced last week that he would hold an “extended meeting” with Xi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan. The two-day summit gets underway on Friday.

Negotiations between Washington and Beijing broke down in early May after Trump accused China of retreating from previous commitments, causing a market sell-off.

Trump then slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatened to impose tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods, a scenario that Goldman Sachs says could sink equity markets as much as 4%.

""The best the market can expect out of the G20 is a handshake and a commitment to resume talking,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri.

This could be enough to pep up the trade-weary market while anything less could cause the market to nosedive.

2. Fed Speakers

Appearances this week by several Fed policymakers will be closely watched after the U.S. central bank indicated last week that it could cut interest rates to offset global economic uncertainties and subdued inflation.

Fed Chairman will discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, in New York on Tuesday.

New York Fed head John Williams and St Louis Fed President James Bullard are both due to speak the same day. Bullard the Fed’s decision to keep rates on hold last week, instead favoring a quarter percentage point rate cut.

One uncertainty investors face is whether positive Trump-Xi talks could delay a Fed rate cut.

U.S. economic growth, while slowing, is strong enough that ""the Fed can afford to wait a while"" to monitor trade-talk progress, Wells Fargo's Christopher said.

But if investors have to weigh a trade de-escalation with the possibility of fewer-than-hoped-for rate cuts, they will likely recognize ""that a trade deal is a more powerful boost to U.S. growth than Fed cuts,"" said Manulife's Donald.

3. U.S. Economic Data

Some key U.S. economic reports this week include the release of data on Wednesday along with figures on international trade.

Investors will also get an update on the health of the U.S. housing market from reports on , and the .

The week will also bring the final reading on first-quarter gross domestic product, with the consensus forecast for an unrevised reading of .

4. Euro Zone Inflation

Friday’s euro zone will tell whether European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was right to warn that more monetary easing would come unless prices started rising faster.

Inflation has undershot the ECB's near 2% target since 2013. The rate was 1.2% in May. The bank is worried, but it is a dilemma shared by policymakers in many countries, not least the U.S. and Japan.

But Draghi's words have made a mark. A closely-tracked key market inflation gauge -- the five-year, five-year break even forward -- has shot up to 1.3%, having languished at record lows at around 1.12% ahead of Tuesday's speech.

Economists say ""real economy"" indicators, wages, for instance, paint a less pessimistic inflation outlook, raising questions about whether Draghi's reaction to market-based inflation measures is warranted.

5. Earnings to Watch

Homebuilder Lennar (NYSE: ) is due to report before the open on Tuesday, while KB Home (NYSE: ) is set to release its earnings report a day later.

The world’s largest package shipment company, FedEx (NYSE: ) will report Q4 earnings after the close on Tuesday, amid concerns about its business being hit by the lingering China-U.S. trade dispute and slowing global growth.

On Thursday, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: ) is set to report ahead of the open, while sportswear powerhouse Nike (NYSE: ) will report after the close.

Constellation Brands (NYSE: ), the brewer of popular beer brand Corona, is set to report on Friday before the market open.

By Kevin Yao and Ben Blanchard

BEIJING (Reuters) - Both China and the United States should make compromises in trade talks, Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said on Monday, ahead of a much anticipated meeting between the Chinese and U.S. presidents at this week's G20 summit in Japan.

China and the United States last week said they were reviving talks ahead of the meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. Hopes that it will lead to a de-escalation of a trade war that is damaging the global economy has cheered financial markets.

Talks to reach a broad deal broke down last month after U.S. officials accused China of backing away from previously agreed commitments.

Speaking at a news briefing on the G20 summit, Wang, who is also part of the trade negotiating team with the United States, said talks between the two countries' trade teams were underway, though he gave no details.

China's principles are clear, he said - mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and meeting each other halfway.

""Mutual respect means each side must respect the other's sovereignty,"" Wang said.

""Equality and mutual benefit means the consultations have to happen on an equal basis, the agreement to be reached has to be beneficial for both sides,"" he said.

""Meeting each other half way means both sides have to compromise and make concessions, not just one side.""

Wang declined to answer a question about what specific compromises Xi may offer to win a trade deal with Trump.

Both the Chinese and U.S. teams are making preparations for the Xi-Trump meeting, Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Jun told the same briefing, again without offering details.

The two countries are in the middle of a costly trade dispute and have slapped increasingly severe tariffs on each other's imports. China has vowed to not give in on issues of principle nor under U.S. pressure.

Trump has threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion of goods, covering nearly all the remaining Chinese imports into the United States, including consumer products such as cellphones, computers and clothing.

RISING ECONOMIC RISKS

Wang said rising protectionism has dampened global trade and posed a threat to the global economy, while Chen Yulu, a vice governor of China's central bank, warned that global economic and financial risks are rising significantly.

""Signs of reversing monetary policy in major developed countries are becoming more evident,"" Chen told the same briefing.

""At the same time, policy room of many countries after the crisis has been reduced and room for coping with a sharp economic slowdown is limited.""

Last week, the Federal Reserve signaled interest rate cuts beginning as early as July to cope with growing economic risks, which analysts say could increase pressure on China's central bank to ease policy to support the slowing economy.

Another problem is U.S. sanctions on Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co Inc.

Wang said that Xi, when speaking by telephone to Trump last week, had said he hopes the United States can fairly treat Chinese companies.

""We hope that the U.S. can remove certain unilateral measures inappropriately taken against Chinese companies, in the spirit of free trade and the World Trade Organization.""

The Trump administration has accused China of failing to protect intellectual property rights, forced technology transfers and of failing to provide a level playing field for U.S. companies.

China has repeatedly promised to open its market wider to foreign investors and provide them with better services and treatment. China has also denied accusations of failing to protect intellectual property rights or of forcing foreign companies to transfer technology."

By Barani Krishnan

Investing.com - One week ago, we were talking about an Iranian attack on oil tankers. This week’s conversation was dominated by Iran’s downing of a U.S. drone and how President Donald Trump almost retaliated, before standing down in the final minutes. It wouldn’t be too surprising if next week brings another provocative Iran attack of some kind to push the president's button again.

As Olivier Jakob, founder of Swiss energy consultancy PetroMatrix, commented wryly on Friday: “In view of the 2020 elections, President Trump is facing a formidable challenge to address the military provocations of Iran, while avoiding a spike in gasoline prices and a correction of the stock market.”

Trump spoke of “major additional sanctions” against Iran on Saturday, before being holed up at Camp David, to plan his next move against the Islamic Republic. Last week’s 9% jump in U.S. was its biggest since Nov. 2016. 5% weekly gain was the most since the week ended Feb. 15.

On the precious metals front, bullion and futures of gold breached the magical $1,400 mark, hitting near six-year highs. With $1,500 being touted as the next target of gold bugs, some wonder if the yellow metal is better positioned than oil to benefit from the war cries in the Middle East -- as well as the Federal Reserve’s widely-expected rate cut.

Energy Review

There was no weekend short-covering for Iranian risk in the previous week despite the attack on the oil tankers. After this week though, we can't be sure that risk traders can ignore Iran anymore.

The FAA has ordered U.S. airlines to stay clear of the skies of Iran and it is likely that others will follow suit. Military escalation is a weekend risk.

As Jakob of PetroMatrix noted, the U.S. president first called out Iran on making a ""very big mistake” on the drone strike, before pinning blame on an Iranian general ""who was loose and stupid”. ""Trump clearly does not want to engage in a Middle-East war, but it will be harder and harder for the White House to leave the momentum to Iran without any U.S. response.""

Price wise, Brent's backwardation has eased further and WTI is almost out of contango despite high Cushing stocks. Gasoline has also seen strong support after a fire at the PES Philadelphia refinery.

Crude’s rally could extend into the coming week if the U.S. Energy Information Administration issues another strong dataset on crude stockpiles and gasoline demand like in the just-ended week.

Next week will be the final stretch before the July 1-2 meetings of OPEC and its key non-members’ alliance led by Russia. Typically, it is a time when OPEC ministers are most energetic in talking up oil prices. And the debate before them on extending production cuts by another six months will be rich for rhetoric.

Adding to that will be G20 in Osaka, where the star billing is Trump’s highly-anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Oil prices could also see another sharp upside if the U.S. president and his team hold, as he has promised, positive talks with China’s President Xi Jinping and negotiators from Beijing at the G20 meeting next weekend.

All these are hypothetical by the way, as a fall through in any could result in a fresh tumble in oil prices.

Precious Metals Review

Gold has been on an uptrend since the start of June, on speculation of a U.S. interest-rate cut. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve opened the door for a possible rate cut in the future, sending the yield on the benchmark Treasury note below 2% — a key psychological level — for the first time since November 2016.

Investing.com's sees a rate cut coming at the Fed's July 30-31 meeting.

Lower interest rates make safe-haven assets such as gold, which does not yield interest, more attractive while weighing on the U.S. dollar. In Friday’s session, the , measured against a basket of six currencies, hit a three-month low of 95.76.

“Should August gold climb and sustain above $1,420, my work will point to $1,445 to 1,450 as a minimum next target zone thereafter,” said Mike Paulenoff, gold commentator at MPTrader.com. “This will argue that its multi-year upside breakout will continue unabated, perhaps in reaction to the combination of an easier Fed, a weaker USD, rising inflationary expectations and heightened geopolitical tensions,” Paulenoff added.

, reflective of trades in bullion, peaked on Friday at $1,411.72, its highest since Sept. 2013. For the week, spot gold was up 4.4% while for the month, it showed a gain of 9.7%.

for August delivery, traded on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, settled Friday’s trade up $3.20, or 0.2%, at $1,400.10 per ounce. It earlier peaked at $1,414.95, its highest since Oct. 2013, when it rose to nearly $1,454. For the week, August gold was up 4.5%. For the month, it showed a gain of 10%.

Some are now talking of $1,500 levels and beyond if conflict in the Middle East reaches new heights after Thursday’s drone downing by Iran, and signs that the Fed could cut rates by 50 basis points or so by next month itself.

“$1,500 looks like the next big round target,” said Philip Streible, senior market strategist for precious metals at RJO Fututres in Chicago. “Of course, there’s a lot of stop losses out there that need to happen first.”

By Saikat Chatterjee and Helen Reid

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors have sharply increased their use of hedging strategies, signaling concerns that the intensifying trade battle between the United States and China might hit economies from Germany to South Korea.

Money managers say that mounting barriers to trade between the United States and trading partners -- Washington's latest proposal for tariffs on $675 billion of Chinese goods is expected to elicit a response from Beijing -- is prompting them to look for ways to protect profits in the event equity markets take a dive after years of growth.

That includes bets against declines in equity indexes and currencies as well as dividends and bonds.

""Only now have trade war concerns grabbed the spotlight for investors after bubbling away in the background for most of this year, prompting the rush for such hedging trades,"" said Gerard Fitzpatrick, London-based chief investment officer for Europe Middle East and Africa at Russell Investments, which has nearly $300 billion of assets under management.

Trade isn't the only issue weighing on investors' minds. European growth has lost steam, oil prices are near $80 a barrel while the U.S., European and many emerging central banks are tightening monetary policy.

And politics could exacerbate any downturn, with Germany's coalition in uproar over migration, and Italy's new government flirting with a big-spending, possibly eurosceptic, agenda.

Hedging strategies also carry risk, however, namely that an anticipated market fall does not materialize.

Despite rising concerns among investors, the world economy is on a strong footing, with the global economy expected to grow 3.9 percent this year and next, according to the International Monetary Fund.

While many investors are reducing their exposure to equities, most remain reluctant to completely move away from stocks. As a result, demand has risen for investment positions aimed at offsetting potential losses, according to money managers, market indicators and data.

That includes trades such as ""put"" options on certain indexes - allowing them to sell at a preset price if the index falls below a certain level in exchange for paying a premium - or short selling the bonds of highly indebted companies.

Short selling is when hedge funds and other investors borrow securities and sell them, betting the price will fall so they can buy them back later at a lower price for return to the lender.

Investors also appear to be seeking more options market protection against currency losses, especially on trade-sensitive currencies such as the Australian dollar or the , via purchasing put options on these currencies in the $5.1 trillion a day foreign exchange markets.

""Some of these trades are an extension to what we have been seeing from earlier this year but there is no doubt that there is increased nervousness now reflected in markets,"" said Eugene Philalithis, a portfolio manager at Fidelity International, which manages $2.4 trillion assets under management globally.

""CRASH INSURANCE""

Shifts in the costs of derivatives indicate hedging demand has picked up since trade concerns intensified.

For instance, the cost of hedging against falls in Germany's DAX index ( ), highly exposed to exports to the United States and China, has increased sharply in the past week, according to Mathilde Richardot, a derivatives strategist at BNP Paribas (PA: ) based in London.

The Volatility Index skew - a measure that derivatives markets look at to gauge demand for protection against volatility spikes - hit an all-time high as investors bought protection against sharp drops in equity prices for July and August. Similar moves were seen in U.S. stocks. ( )

Some market specialists say out-of-the-money put options are increasingly popular; they are typically cheaper and provide protection in the event of larger price drops.

Investors have also purchased options that hedge against a drop of 10 percent or more in U.S. indexes, according to UBS strategists.

Open interest - or the value of such options outstanding and a gauge of demand from investors - on put options on the S&P 500 index ( ) falling around 10 percent from current levels maturing in the next two weeks is far greater than on other options, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Such is the demand for such ""crash insurance"" that James Purcell, head of alternative and sustainable investments at UBS Global Wealth Management said they are advising clients to look at other markets such as Hong Kong and South Korea to hedge equity market downside risks.

Edmund Shing, head of global equity derivatives at BNP Paribas says ""the whole point of insurance is you should buy it if it's cheap.""

Such trades are attractively priced because volatility, despite the souring environment, remains low, a phenomenon some put down to central bank liquidity supporting asset prices.

A gauge of expected S&P500 volatility is half the level of highs hit in February ( ).

Interest by investors in dividend hedging is also on the rise. While bumper shareholder payouts alongside buybacks have driven much of the equity bonanza in recent years, logic dictates that any glitch in the corporate cycle will cause dividends to be cut.

Investors often buy dividend futures, or contracts that allow them to bet on companies' future payouts.

But ""puts"" on Eurostoxx 50 dividend futures are drawing more interest, according to Societe Generale (PA: ) and BNP Paribas, banks that dominate Europe's equity derivatives business.

When the global economy is doing well, companies are comfortable paying out dividends to their investors but at the first sign of market stress, companies want to conserve precious cash flow so ""dividends suffer a lot more,"" said Charles de Boissezon, deputy head of global asset allocation strategy at Societe Generale.

Once the preserve of hedge funds, mainstream asset managers and pension funds increasingly use dividend futures, he added.

The Euro Stoxx 50 dividend futures index ( ), which aggregates dividend futures contracts, is down 2.1 percent year-to-date, after six consecutive years of gains, suggesting investors expect dividends to decline.

Away from derivatives, outright short interest in emerging market equities has picked up on concerns that this sector would be worst hit should a trade war break out. Short interest measures the number of short positions not yet closed out.

Short bets in emerging market equities scaled a post-crisis high of $110 billion in early June, with China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and New Zealand among the most shorted markets, according to data from IHS Markit.

BOND MARKETS

Bond markets have not been spared. Investors have built a notional $55 billion of short positions in U.S. dollar-denominated investment-grade corporate debt, according to IHS Markit. Short positions are up $8 billion this year and rose more than $2.3 billion since the end of April, IHS Markit data shows.

High-grade bonds have performed poorly this year; this and the short bets are down to companies' high debt levels -- almost all U.S. sectors' leverage ratios were above their 20-year average as of end-2017, Societe Generale estimates.

This makes companies vulnerable to rising borrowing costs as well as higher tariffs.

A trade war would darken the overall outlook but some currencies, including the Australian dollar or from emerging markets, are expected to suffer more than others.

Investors went long the dollar the week of June 18 against emerging currencies for the first time in eight months . Australia's dollar is near 1-1/2 year lows as the country boasts China as its biggest trading partner.

Derivative markets suggest investors are increasingly risk averse.

Three-month risk reversals on the Australian dollar , a ratio of calls to puts, is near 2018 lows. A similar gauge on the Swiss franc , a perceived safe-haven in the currency markets, indicates bullish positions on the franc at near two-month highs.

(Bloomberg) -- A hedge fund that reaped an outrageous gain in February’s vol-mageddon is eyeing a fresh target.

Houndstooth Capital Management LLC secured a 6,000 percent return from a bearish bet on an exchange-traded product tied to calm markets.

Now, the $7.5 million fund sees trouble in an ETF designed to profit from the opposite -- turbulence in stocks. It’s wagering technical forces in the volatility complex will help spur a swift return to stability in the wake of a blowout, undoing the leveraged product in its wake.

It goes like this: Even though Houndstooth expects another surge in price swings, it’s using out-of-the-money puts with near-term maturities to bet against the $413 million ProShares Ultra Short-Term Futures ETF. UVXY, as it is known, is one of the most liquid, leveraged ETFs that profit from rising volatility. The theory is that after an initial spike there will be a snapback in vol that will decimate the product.

“We’re looking for areas where buying or selling volatility is mispriced by the market, or at least where we think there’s a very good risk-reward trade-off,” Lincoln Edwards, founder at Houndstooth, said in an interview. “There’s a risk that another massive VIX spike could destroy UVXY in a single day.”

Tucker Hewes, a spokesman for ProShares at Hewes Communications, declined to comment.

The capital behind the trade is modest, but it highlights the contentious issue of whether securities such as UVXY can exert an outsize pull on the very contracts they track, exacerbating their own volatility in the process.

Hot Summer

Volatility investing has boomed in recent years as ETPs offered cheap and liquid ways for professional money managers and retail investors to punt on the burgeoning asset class. As Wall Street warns of a “hot” summer full of risk, and a more normal regime for volatility after two placid years, many traders are betting on bigger price swings in the latter half of the year.

And that’s how Houndstooth made its spectacular February return. The Austin, Texas-based firm bought put options on the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, or SVXY, thinking that an upward move in the Cboe Volatility Index would shake sellers out of their torpor. Sure enough, the gauge staged a record-one day spike, sending the ETF plummeting 83 percent -- and handing the fund its best-ever first quarter with a double-digit gain.

Houndstooth reckons it has a keen eye for technical risks in the underbelly of the volatility complex. Since the VIX isn’t tradable, many products hold futures contracts on the gauge. Given their size, some participants say they can exert a large pull on the price of the assets they track, underscored by the spectacular collapse of ETNs linked to calm markets in February.

Both long and short products buy and sell futures contracts on a daily basis to maintain their desired degree of exposure to implied equity volatility. That means a large one-way move in the VIX can dramatically increase the number of contracts they need to buy -- challenging liquidity and potentially driving the price of futures higher, according to Edwards.

Cboe Global Markets Inc. didn’t immediately respond to an email request seeking comment. It has recently outlined changes to the monthly auction for the VIX settlement.

Scenarios

For the Houndstooth strategy to pay off, VIX futures need to lose two-thirds of their value in a single day. That, in theory, would be enough to send the price of the 1.5-times leveraged UVXY to zero.

“Even if VIX futures gained 200 percent or even 10,000 percent in a single day, a one-day decline of 66 percent makes UVXY worth $0 regardless of how high it climbed,” Edwards said.

Of course, the grip ETFs assert on VIX futures likely diminished after February, as products either closed or shrank, while several ProShares ETFs reduced leverage, including UVXY, curbing their need to rebalance after sharp moves.

And the scenario didn’t play out after the VIX’s record spike on Feb. 5. The next day, the volatility gauge slumped by one-fifth -- only enough to send UVXY down by a third for the day.

Still, buying put options on the ETF rather than shorting it allows Houndstooth to limit potential losses on the trade, and there are a few scenarios that could lead to its success.

Under one, the VIX spikes from its current level to 40. The next day, as panic eases, the gauge knifes back down, its movements exacerbated by long buyers rushing to cover positions, and by volatility products flooding the futures market to rebalance holdings.

In another, the VIX could surge on bad-news speculation and then quickly reverse, producing a large enough intraday spike for the bet to pay off. Alternatively, the gauge could gradually climb higher -- only to deflate suddenly if favorable news emerges.

Edwards believes volatility is poised to move higher as November’s U.S. congressional elections approach.

“We’ll also see a third interest-rate hike, which will spark much more volatility than what we’re seeing now. Political uncertainty in Europe will continue causing major fits of volatility. Expect to see the VIX over 30 at least one more time this year,” he said.

The Houndstooth investor concedes that a 6,000 percent return on the strategy is a tail scenario -- but one “that’s massively underappreciated and underpriced.”

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks sank in a broad sell-off on Monday, with the trading down more than 2.0 percent in the afternoon and technology firms bearing the brunt of an escalating trade dispute between the United States and other leading economies.

The U.S. Treasury Department was drafting curbs that would block firms with at least 25 percent Chinese ownership from buying U.S. technology firms, a government official said on Sunday. A Wall Street Journal report also said the U.S. planned to block additional technology exports to China.

The Dow ( ) fell 1.8 percent and the Nasdaq ( ) was down 2.6 percent. The S&P technology index .SPLRCT dropped almost 3.0 percent and the Philadelphia Semiconductor index .SOX dropped 3.6 percent, with chipmakers taking a hit as they depend on China for a large part of their revenue.

COMMENTS:

RANDY FREDERICK, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab (NYSE: ) in Austin, Texas

“The things that have caused this market to not be happy at the beginning of the day have not abated at all. As a result there is no reason to think it won’t weaken into the close.

""The 50-day (moving average) was providing a little bit of support right at the get-go and then the 100-day sort of looked like it was the stop but if I am a technical guy I am worried about the 200-day now, which is frankly, a ways down there. That is 2,6664, that is not a number I want to get anywhere near. But if you look back at the pullbacks we had in early April and early May both of them didn’t really bounce until they hit the 200-day, so I would be a little cautious here.

""This is an incredibly tough market to not only forecast but also to trade because fundamentals are really strong everywhere – corporate earnings are great, labor market is great, everything is great – but you can’t trade technicals when everything is going on is being driven by news and geopolitical tensions. So how do you predict the next hour or next day what might come out of Washington? I just don’t know how you trade this thing, I don’t know how you forecast it, because you don’t know. It is a tough one. I can only forecast based on fundamentals and technicals, I can’t predict the news.

""As long as this stuff is out there and until we see somebody backpedaling, we see somebody flinch, we see some progress in negotiations which we all think is part of the game, we haven’t see any of that, I would be cautious here. I don’t like it, I hate to think this kind of stuff could derail all of the fundamental strength we have but in the near-term, it looks like it.”

WAYNE KAUFMAN, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT PHOENIX FINANCIAL SERVICES IN NEW YORK:

“People are scared, the market does not like uncertainty. And a trade war is something that is difficult, if not impossible, to handicap. A lot of profit taking on stocks that had been leaders. Selling in the cyclical and big industrial international stocks – that’s a continuation – and until people get some clarity, it may be difficult for investors to show a lot of conviction in terms of being long.”

PETER JANKOVSKIS, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, OAKBROOK INVESTMENTS LLC, LISLE, ILLINOIS:

“The story out there today is about trade tensions with China, the latest development with regard to limiting investment in U.S. firms. We’re seeing some areas holding up reasonably well: telecom, utilities and consumer staples. Industrials and technology stocks, with their extended valuations, are the sectors that are struggling today.

“[Future market performance] depends a lot on the statements we hear from the respective parties. I don’t expect a rebound, but I don’t expect the pace of selling we’re seeing today to continue either.”

ANDREW FRANKEL, CO-PRESIDENT OF STUART FRANKEL & CO IN NEW YORK:

""It was a technical level the S&P broke (the 100 day moving average). When we broke that it sold off and now you're seeing it hovering around that level.""

""Amidst a day the volume isn't robust, technical levels can play a key role ... That added a little fuel to the move lower. Overall from a trading perspective you see a self-fulfilling prophesy. The lower the tape goes, people will rein in exposure. Sometimes selling begets selling. There's a backdrop of trade concerns.""

""We're due for some sort of pullback. You've multiple sectors getting hurt. It makes me feel you've got exposure being taken down.""

J. BRYANT EVANS, INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER, COZAD ASSET MANAGEMENT, CHAMPAIGN, ILLINOIS:

""I do think tariff talk is at the front of investors' minds and is what is influencing the market more than anything else today. It's really hard to know just how all of this is going to shake out. For sure, we are looking at negative issues for U.S. agriculture products, for steel and other basic materials, especially aluminum, and also how all of the tit-for-tat shakes out with different countries. That's going to affect different companies differently.

There's just a lot of uncertainty about whether the plans are going to work out for the better or not.""

BRIAN BATTLE, DIRECTOR OF TRADING, PERFORMANCE TRUST CAPITAL PARTNERS, CHICAGO

“The market is perceiving that politics will become policy. The market is starting to price in that the tariffs will start to become real. The rhetoric is getting stronger rather than weaker. We'll keep trading off if the trend persists.”

""A trade war means lower global GDP. It's bad for growth. What we've seen in the last nine days was a measured sell off. We're still barely positive for the year.”

""The rhetoric is foreboding. It’s not sounding better and the deadline is getting closer.""

""There's going to be a measured retreat. You want to have appropriate window dressing for quarter end. You can't have a bunch of cash you have to have a positions. That's part of why its measured.""

“It’s now all about the whole trade dialogue, which seems to be going in the wrong direction. Most market participants and most companies would really like to see a resolution of trade policy so people understand what the polices are.""

“It’s seeming like it is. It’s beginning to seem like these positions that are extreme and punitive are actually not just a negotiating strategy, it looks like they might be reality. And if they're reality, then it causes all kinds of disruption to global business endeavors. Pretty much every company in their supply chain...suddenly they have got a cost or an uncertainty.”

Investing.com - Market watchers will be looking ahead to a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping this week amid hopes for a thaw in trade relations, even if it alters expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.

A line-up of Fed speakers, as well as fresh economic data and earnings will also command investors’ attention. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

1. G20 Meeting

Trump announced last week that he would hold an “extended meeting” with Xi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan. The two-day summit gets underway on Friday.

Negotiations between Washington and Beijing broke down in early May after Trump accused China of retreating from previous commitments, causing a market sell-off.

Trump then slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatened to impose tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods, a scenario that Goldman Sachs says could sink equity markets as much as 4%.

""The best the market can expect out of the G20 is a handshake and a commitment to resume talking,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri.

This could be enough to pep up the trade-weary market while anything less could cause the market to nosedive.

2. Fed Speakers

Appearances this week by several Fed policymakers will be closely watched after the U.S. central bank indicated last week that it could cut interest rates to offset global economic uncertainties and subdued inflation.

Fed Chairman will discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, in New York on Tuesday.

New York Fed head John Williams and St Louis Fed President James Bullard are both due to speak the same day. Bullard the Fed’s decision to keep rates on hold last week, instead favoring a quarter percentage point rate cut.

One uncertainty investors face is whether positive Trump-Xi talks could delay a Fed rate cut.

U.S. economic growth, while slowing, is strong enough that ""the Fed can afford to wait a while"" to monitor trade-talk progress, Wells Fargo's Christopher said.

But if investors have to weigh a trade de-escalation with the possibility of fewer-than-hoped-for rate cuts, they will likely recognize ""that a trade deal is a more powerful boost to U.S. growth than Fed cuts,"" said Manulife's Donald.

3. U.S. Economic Data

Some key U.S. economic reports this week include the release of data on Wednesday along with figures on international trade.

Investors will also get an update on the health of the U.S. housing market from reports on , and the .

The week will also bring the final reading on first-quarter gross domestic product, with the consensus forecast for an unrevised reading of .

4. Euro Zone Inflation

Friday’s euro zone will tell whether European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was right to warn that more monetary easing would come unless prices started rising faster.

Inflation has undershot the ECB's near 2% target since 2013. The rate was 1.2% in May. The bank is worried, but it is a dilemma shared by policymakers in many countries, not least the U.S. and Japan.

But Draghi's words have made a mark. A closely-tracked key market inflation gauge -- the five-year, five-year break even forward -- has shot up to 1.3%, having languished at record lows at around 1.12% ahead of Tuesday's speech.

Economists say ""real economy"" indicators, wages, for instance, paint a less pessimistic inflation outlook, raising questions about whether Draghi's reaction to market-based inflation measures is warranted.

5. Earnings to Watch

Homebuilder Lennar (NYSE: ) is due to report before the open on Tuesday, while KB Home (NYSE: ) is set to release its earnings report a day later.

The world’s largest package shipment company, FedEx (NYSE: ) will report Q4 earnings after the close on Tuesday, amid concerns about its business being hit by the lingering China-U.S. trade dispute and slowing global growth.

On Thursday, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: ) is set to report ahead of the open, while sportswear powerhouse Nike (NYSE: ) will report after the close.

Constellation Brands (NYSE: ), the brewer of popular beer brand Corona, is set to report on Friday before the market open.

By Kevin Yao and Ben Blanchard

BEIJING (Reuters) - Both China and the United States should make compromises in trade talks, Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said on Monday, ahead of a much anticipated meeting between the Chinese and U.S. presidents at this week's G20 summit in Japan.

China and the United States last week said they were reviving talks ahead of the meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. Hopes that it will lead to a de-escalation of a trade war that is damaging the global economy has cheered financial markets.

Talks to reach a broad deal broke down last month after U.S. officials accused China of backing away from previously agreed commitments.

Speaking at a news briefing on the G20 summit, Wang, who is also part of the trade negotiating team with the United States, said talks between the two countries' trade teams were underway, though he gave no details.

China's principles are clear, he said - mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and meeting each other halfway.

""Mutual respect means each side must respect the other's sovereignty,"" Wang said.

""Equality and mutual benefit means the consultations have to happen on an equal basis, the agreement to be reached has to be beneficial for both sides,"" he said.

""Meeting each other half way means both sides have to compromise and make concessions, not just one side.""

Wang declined to answer a question about what specific compromises Xi may offer to win a trade deal with Trump.

Both the Chinese and U.S. teams are making preparations for the Xi-Trump meeting, Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Jun told the same briefing, again without offering details.

The two countries are in the middle of a costly trade dispute and have slapped increasingly severe tariffs on each other's imports. China has vowed to not give in on issues of principle nor under U.S. pressure.

Trump has threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion of goods, covering nearly all the remaining Chinese imports into the United States, including consumer products such as cellphones, computers and clothing.

RISING ECONOMIC RISKS

Wang said rising protectionism has dampened global trade and posed a threat to the global economy, while Chen Yulu, a vice governor of China's central bank, warned that global economic and financial risks are rising significantly.

""Signs of reversing monetary policy in major developed countries are becoming more evident,"" Chen told the same briefing.

""At the same time, policy room of many countries after the crisis has been reduced and room for coping with a sharp economic slowdown is limited.""

Last week, the Federal Reserve signaled interest rate cuts beginning as early as July to cope with growing economic risks, which analysts say could increase pressure on China's central bank to ease policy to support the slowing economy.

Another problem is U.S. sanctions on Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co Inc.

Wang said that Xi, when speaking by telephone to Trump last week, had said he hopes the United States can fairly treat Chinese companies.

""We hope that the U.S. can remove certain unilateral measures inappropriately taken against Chinese companies, in the spirit of free trade and the World Trade Organization.""

The Trump administration has accused China of failing to protect intellectual property rights, forced technology transfers and of failing to provide a level playing field for U.S. companies.

China has repeatedly promised to open its market wider to foreign investors and provide them with better services and treatment. China has also denied accusations of failing to protect intellectual property rights or of forcing foreign companies to transfer technology."

By Barani Krishnan

Investing.com - One week ago, we were talking about an Iranian attack on oil tankers. This week’s conversation was dominated by Iran’s downing of a U.S. drone and how President Donald Trump almost retaliated, before standing down in the final minutes. It wouldn’t be too surprising if next week brings another provocative Iran attack of some kind to push the president's button again.

As Olivier Jakob, founder of Swiss energy consultancy PetroMatrix, commented wryly on Friday: “In view of the 2020 elections, President Trump is facing a formidable challenge to address the military provocations of Iran, while avoiding a spike in gasoline prices and a correction of the stock market.”

Trump spoke of “major additional sanctions” against Iran on Saturday, before being holed up at Camp David, to plan his next move against the Islamic Republic. Last week’s 9% jump in U.S. was its biggest since Nov. 2016. 5% weekly gain was the most since the week ended Feb. 15.

On the precious metals front, bullion and futures of gold breached the magical $1,400 mark, hitting near six-year highs. With $1,500 being touted as the next target of gold bugs, some wonder if the yellow metal is better positioned than oil to benefit from the war cries in the Middle East -- as well as the Federal Reserve’s widely-expected rate cut.

Energy Review

There was no weekend short-covering for Iranian risk in the previous week despite the attack on the oil tankers. After this week though, we can't be sure that risk traders can ignore Iran anymore.

The FAA has ordered U.S. airlines to stay clear of the skies of Iran and it is likely that others will follow suit. Military escalation is a weekend risk.

As Jakob of PetroMatrix noted, the U.S. president first called out Iran on making a ""very big mistake” on the drone strike, before pinning blame on an Iranian general ""who was loose and stupid”. ""Trump clearly does not want to engage in a Middle-East war, but it will be harder and harder for the White House to leave the momentum to Iran without any U.S. response.""

Price wise, Brent's backwardation has eased further and WTI is almost out of contango despite high Cushing stocks. Gasoline has also seen strong support after a fire at the PES Philadelphia refinery.

Crude’s rally could extend into the coming week if the U.S. Energy Information Administration issues another strong dataset on crude stockpiles and gasoline demand like in the just-ended week.

Next week will be the final stretch before the July 1-2 meetings of OPEC and its key non-members’ alliance led by Russia. Typically, it is a time when OPEC ministers are most energetic in talking up oil prices. And the debate before them on extending production cuts by another six months will be rich for rhetoric.

Adding to that will be G20 in Osaka, where the star billing is Trump’s highly-anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Oil prices could also see another sharp upside if the U.S. president and his team hold, as he has promised, positive talks with China’s President Xi Jinping and negotiators from Beijing at the G20 meeting next weekend.

All these are hypothetical by the way, as a fall through in any could result in a fresh tumble in oil prices.

Precious Metals Review

Gold has been on an uptrend since the start of June, on speculation of a U.S. interest-rate cut. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve opened the door for a possible rate cut in the future, sending the yield on the benchmark Treasury note below 2% — a key psychological level — for the first time since November 2016.

Investing.com's sees a rate cut coming at the Fed's July 30-31 meeting.

Lower interest rates make safe-haven assets such as gold, which does not yield interest, more attractive while weighing on the U.S. dollar. In Friday’s session, the , measured against a basket of six currencies, hit a three-month low of 95.76.

“Should August gold climb and sustain above $1,420, my work will point to $1,445 to 1,450 as a minimum next target zone thereafter,” said Mike Paulenoff, gold commentator at MPTrader.com. “This will argue that its multi-year upside breakout will continue unabated, perhaps in reaction to the combination of an easier Fed, a weaker USD, rising inflationary expectations and heightened geopolitical tensions,” Paulenoff added.

, reflective of trades in bullion, peaked on Friday at $1,411.72, its highest since Sept. 2013. For the week, spot gold was up 4.4% while for the month, it showed a gain of 9.7%.

for August delivery, traded on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, settled Friday’s trade up $3.20, or 0.2%, at $1,400.10 per ounce. It earlier peaked at $1,414.95, its highest since Oct. 2013, when it rose to nearly $1,454. For the week, August gold was up 4.5%. For the month, it showed a gain of 10%.

Some are now talking of $1,500 levels and beyond if conflict in the Middle East reaches new heights after Thursday’s drone downing by Iran, and signs that the Fed could cut rates by 50 basis points or so by next month itself.

“$1,500 looks like the next big round target,” said Philip Streible, senior market strategist for precious metals at RJO Fututres in Chicago. “Of course, there’s a lot of stop losses out there that need to happen first.”

(Bloomberg) -- Equity volatility is elevated but options trading shows investors’ appetite for protection hasn’t picked up, indicating hedging is needed, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: ).

Strategists led by John Marshall observed that “a large number” of hedges expired over the past three weeks, leaving the average investor more exposed to stock swings. Meanwhile, the Cboe Volatility Index almost doubled in the first quarter as concerns over global trade tensions and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stirred up market turbulence. The options gauge, known as , jumped 20 percent to 23.89 as of 12:11 p.m. in New York.

While the heightened volatility has been largely contained in the stock market, that increase may suppress the risk appetite in other assets over the coming months, potentially spurring widespread turbulence, according to Goldman Sachs.

“A shift towards risk reduction and expectation of higher volatility is likely to change the trading dynamics in 2018 and increase the value of time spent on hedging,” the strategists wrote in a note to clients. “The spike in VIX and realized volatility was large enough for investors outside the equity market to take notice.”

The firm identified seven major concerns, including a credit meltdown and growth deceleration, as the biggest threat to financial markets. After studying the relationship between each risk factor and all asset classes, the strategists recommended the cheapest options for each dangerous scenario.

Investors fretting over credit stress should buy options on Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund and Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund, they said. For those worried about rising interest rates or inflation, derivative contracts on VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: ) and iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NASDAQ: ) ETF are attractive.

The strategists don’t recommend buying S&P 500 options to hedge against losses in the U.S. equity benchmark, because they see contracts on the and WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund as cheaper.

(Bloomberg) -- Volatility may be here to stay -- but there’s a lot investors can do to prepare for it.

“Hedges against late cycle volatility bursts in credit, dispersion and cross-asset volatility as the equity/bond correlation itself becomes more volatile” are one key theme in Societe Generale (PA: ) SA’s second-quarter outlook from strategists led by Kokou Agbo-Bloua, the firm’s head of flow strategy and solutions. The outlook was published March 30.

The report, titled “Macro ‘Black Mirror”’ after a U.K. television series that looks at unanticipated consequences of technology, warns that advances such as algorithmic trading are exacerbating trading issues with “profound distortions in market liquidity or the illusion thereof,” citing the volatility spiral in early February as an example.

The strategists also say that 2018 will be the first year since 2009 when net inflows of liquidity provided by all central banks will turn negative, setting the stage for regime change in both correlations and cross-asset volatility and risk premia.

By Caroline Valetkevitch

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nervous stock investors are hoping an unusually U.S. strong earnings season can restore some of the optimism that characterized equity markets last year.

Imploding technology stocks and fears of a trade war have pummeled the market in recent days. Given the surge in volatility this year, there is no guarantee that worst is over.

Analysts predict strong results when reporting season starts up next month, with first-quarter profit growth on track to be the highest in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters data. That follows a blockbuster fourth-quarter period, and recent corporate tax cuts that boosted forecasts for all of 2018.

A robust earnings period would bring back the focus on fundamentals and possibly put a floor under prices, supporting views that the 9-year-old bull market will go on, strategists said.

""It's going to be earnings,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. ""The market has given up so much that earnings can start to redirect attention back into a market that has gotten much cheaper relative to where we were.""

With this year's sell-off and rising profit forecasts, stocks also are near the cheapest on a price-to-earnings basis that they have been since late 2016. The S&P 500 is trading at about 16.5 times forward earnings, well below the 18.9 level it was at in mid-December, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Stocks' rout in early February, and more recent selling following worries over a U.S. trade war with China, Facebook (NASDAQ: ) privacy issues and a collapse in other tech leaders, have made investors skittish and more likely to discount the relatively strong economic backdrop that persists.

""We've been caught up in all of these things that could happen and may happen and that the sky is falling, but once earnings season kicks in, it's headline news and that steals away some of the negativity,"" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta.

To be sure, next week brings the monthly U.S. jobs report, a potential catalyst for further volatility. A strong payrolls report in early February had helped spark the stock sell-off that drove the S&P 500 more than 10-percent below its Jan. 26 record high - a ""correction.""

The job report briefly drove up bond yields and touched off worries that the Federal Reserve may need to speed up interest rate hikes. The S&P 500 is now about 8 percent below its record.

Just in the first three months of this year, the S&P has jumped or fallen 1 percent on 23 trading days, three times the number of 1-percent moves it made in all of 2017. In 2016, there were 48 such days.

Market participants agree that U.S. stocks are unlikely to return to the unusually calm conditions seen last year, when the Cboe Volatility Index, the most widely-followed barometer of expected near-term ups and downs for the S&P 500, logged a record low daily average reading of 11. The hit a two-and-a-half-year high above 50 in early February.

Expectations for U.S. earnings this year have jumped since December, when U.S. lawmakers approved sweeping changes to the tax law, including slashing the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Growth in other major economies has also lifted profit forecasts for the large stocks that generate a lot of sales overseas.

Analysts now expect first-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies to rise 18.5 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The first-quarter S&P profit forecast is up 6.3 percentage points since Jan. 1, while the forecast for all of 2018 is up 7.7 points since then, based on Thomson Reuters data.

That suggests the bar might be relatively low for the first quarter. ""You still could see some relative upside there,"" said Keith Parker, U.S. equity strategist at UBS.

Many companies already have announced plans for increased buybacks and dividends, or bringing cash back from overseas, and other ways to use their tax savings. More news on that front is expected this reporting period, which is set to start with reports from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) and others April 13.

""If we get a discussion of repatriation - what companies are going to bring back ... that will have a positive effect on the market,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE: ) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama."

By Marc Jones

LONDON (Reuters) - The turbulent start to 2018 in financial markets has finally brought an end to one of the longest ever global bull runs - and there have been few places to hide.

After last year's tranquillity, as the charts below show, investors have had it all thrown at them this quarter, from the biggest ever rise in stock volatility ( ) to rapidly escalating tensions over global trade, deepening turmoil in the White House and major tech sector wobbles.

A ""melt-up"" that sent the MSCI's world share index up 8 percent in January suddenly evaporated. Now the Dow Jones ( ), S&P 500 ( ), FTSE ( ) Nikkei ( ) and scores of other big markets are all down for the year.

(GRAPHIC: Global markets in first quarter - https://reut.rs/2pKaneV)

As a set, the FAANGs (Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: )) are still up 14 percent, but privacy concerns after it was revealed that 50 million Facebook users' data was misused has wiped $400 billion off their value. Not exactly small change.

(GRAPHIC: The sinking FAANGs - https://reut.rs/2GhhYIe)

""January was a boom month, but there was clearly complacency coming into the market,"" said London & Capital's head of equities Roger Jones. ""That has all changed now"".

Cryptocurrency ( ) has lost 43 percent as well.

Still, it hasn't been a one-way ""risk-off"" doom-fest for markets by any means.

Galloping global growth mean commodities like oil ( ) are up for a third quarter running, stocks in the world's poorest 'frontier' countries are up 4 percent, and Italian bonds have made almost 6 percent returns despite an inconclusive election.

After a stellar 2017, emerging market 'local' currency bonds have done well again too as the , Mexican and Colombian pesos and South Africa's rand have all rallied hard.

(GRAPHIC: Global FX in 2018 - https://reut.rs/2pPldj5)

So has Britain's Brexit-bound pound. It has had its best quarter since early 2015 and not only against a dollar which is locked in its worst run since the financial crisis, but also versus the euro ( ).

""The (political) momentum is to make Brexit work now,"" said one central banker privately.

What the choppy conditions have also reminded people of is the value of a good old-fashioned safe-haven.

Japan's yen is up 6.5 percent, gold is up for a third straight quarter, and the ultra-safe German Bund has made just over 3 percent in dollar terms as its yields have gone in an almost-perfect arc. ( )

But some of the heavyweight central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve, ECB, Peoples Bank of China, Bank of England and Bank of Canada are still looking to raise interest rates. Unlike Bunds, U.S. Treasuries ( ) have lost 3 percent.

It is one of the reasons that stocks have been shaky of course, and it remains one of the main things shaping many investors' view on the rest of the year.

""One thing that it is going to be important to get right now is where to be when bond yields are going up,"" said SEB investment management's global head of asset allocation Hans Peterson.

""We are rotating from the old regime of low interest and growth stocks like the FAANGs into a new world... and that creates volatility."""

A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., on Monday, March 26, 2018. U.S. equities rallied back from the biggest weekly rout in more than two years, with major benchmarks climbing more than 1 percent on signs that an escalation of trade tensions was beginning to ease.

(Bloomberg) -- As market reawakens, mom-and-pop investors just don’t have the stomach for a trade war.

March’s Conference Board survey of U.S. shows retail investors’ enthusiasm for the stock market has dimmed to its lowest levels since the surprise victory of Donald Trump in November 2016.

Only a net 6 percent of those surveyed think equities will be higher in one year; the share was above 30 as recently as January. That was before the tumbled into its first correction in two years and last week’s harrowing selloff that wiped nearly $1 trillion from the value of American equities.

“Consumers aren’t nearly as ebullient on stocks as people assume they are,” said Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro Research. “If stock market tops are borne out of excessive greed, especially at the consumer level, these numbers would suggest that’s not the case right now.”

To the extent that this metric is a contrarian indicator -- as it was in November 2016 -- this implies that investors can expect fairly normal returns from U.S. stocks going forward, he added.

The survey was conducted prior to the Trump administration’s formal announcement of tariffs against China but after the proposed imposition of levies on inbound steel."

Investing.com - Market watchers will be looking ahead to a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping this week amid hopes for a thaw in trade relations, even if it alters expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.

A line-up of Fed speakers, as well as fresh economic data and earnings will also command investors’ attention. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

1. G20 Meeting

Trump announced last week that he would hold an “extended meeting” with Xi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan. The two-day summit gets underway on Friday.

Negotiations between Washington and Beijing broke down in early May after Trump accused China of retreating from previous commitments, causing a market sell-off.

Trump then slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatened to impose tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods, a scenario that Goldman Sachs says could sink equity markets as much as 4%.

""The best the market can expect out of the G20 is a handshake and a commitment to resume talking,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri.

This could be enough to pep up the trade-weary market while anything less could cause the market to nosedive.

2. Fed Speakers

Appearances this week by several Fed policymakers will be closely watched after the U.S. central bank indicated last week that it could cut interest rates to offset global economic uncertainties and subdued inflation.

Fed Chairman will discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, in New York on Tuesday.

New York Fed head John Williams and St Louis Fed President James Bullard are both due to speak the same day. Bullard the Fed’s decision to keep rates on hold last week, instead favoring a quarter percentage point rate cut.

One uncertainty investors face is whether positive Trump-Xi talks could delay a Fed rate cut.

U.S. economic growth, while slowing, is strong enough that ""the Fed can afford to wait a while"" to monitor trade-talk progress, Wells Fargo's Christopher said.

But if investors have to weigh a trade de-escalation with the possibility of fewer-than-hoped-for rate cuts, they will likely recognize ""that a trade deal is a more powerful boost to U.S. growth than Fed cuts,"" said Manulife's Donald.

3. U.S. Economic Data

Some key U.S. economic reports this week include the release of data on Wednesday along with figures on international trade.

Investors will also get an update on the health of the U.S. housing market from reports on , and the .

The week will also bring the final reading on first-quarter gross domestic product, with the consensus forecast for an unrevised reading of .

4. Euro Zone Inflation

Friday’s euro zone will tell whether European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was right to warn that more monetary easing would come unless prices started rising faster.

Inflation has undershot the ECB's near 2% target since 2013. The rate was 1.2% in May. The bank is worried, but it is a dilemma shared by policymakers in many countries, not least the U.S. and Japan.

But Draghi's words have made a mark. A closely-tracked key market inflation gauge -- the five-year, five-year break even forward -- has shot up to 1.3%, having languished at record lows at around 1.12% ahead of Tuesday's speech.

Economists say ""real economy"" indicators, wages, for instance, paint a less pessimistic inflation outlook, raising questions about whether Draghi's reaction to market-based inflation measures is warranted.

5. Earnings to Watch

Homebuilder Lennar (NYSE: ) is due to report before the open on Tuesday, while KB Home (NYSE: ) is set to release its earnings report a day later.

The world’s largest package shipment company, FedEx (NYSE: ) will report Q4 earnings after the close on Tuesday, amid concerns about its business being hit by the lingering China-U.S. trade dispute and slowing global growth.

On Thursday, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: ) is set to report ahead of the open, while sportswear powerhouse Nike (NYSE: ) will report after the close.

Constellation Brands (NYSE: ), the brewer of popular beer brand Corona, is set to report on Friday before the market open.

By Kevin Yao and Ben Blanchard

BEIJING (Reuters) - Both China and the United States should make compromises in trade talks, Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said on Monday, ahead of a much anticipated meeting between the Chinese and U.S. presidents at this week's G20 summit in Japan.

China and the United States last week said they were reviving talks ahead of the meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. Hopes that it will lead to a de-escalation of a trade war that is damaging the global economy has cheered financial markets.

Talks to reach a broad deal broke down last month after U.S. officials accused China of backing away from previously agreed commitments.

Speaking at a news briefing on the G20 summit, Wang, who is also part of the trade negotiating team with the United States, said talks between the two countries' trade teams were underway, though he gave no details.

China's principles are clear, he said - mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and meeting each other halfway.

""Mutual respect means each side must respect the other's sovereignty,"" Wang said.

""Equality and mutual benefit means the consultations have to happen on an equal basis, the agreement to be reached has to be beneficial for both sides,"" he said.

""Meeting each other half way means both sides have to compromise and make concessions, not just one side.""

Wang declined to answer a question about what specific compromises Xi may offer to win a trade deal with Trump.

Both the Chinese and U.S. teams are making preparations for the Xi-Trump meeting, Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Jun told the same briefing, again without offering details.

The two countries are in the middle of a costly trade dispute and have slapped increasingly severe tariffs on each other's imports. China has vowed to not give in on issues of principle nor under U.S. pressure.

Trump has threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion of goods, covering nearly all the remaining Chinese imports into the United States, including consumer products such as cellphones, computers and clothing.

RISING ECONOMIC RISKS

Wang said rising protectionism has dampened global trade and posed a threat to the global economy, while Chen Yulu, a vice governor of China's central bank, warned that global economic and financial risks are rising significantly.

""Signs of reversing monetary policy in major developed countries are becoming more evident,"" Chen told the same briefing.

""At the same time, policy room of many countries after the crisis has been reduced and room for coping with a sharp economic slowdown is limited.""

Last week, the Federal Reserve signaled interest rate cuts beginning as early as July to cope with growing economic risks, which analysts say could increase pressure on China's central bank to ease policy to support the slowing economy.

Another problem is U.S. sanctions on Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co Inc.

Wang said that Xi, when speaking by telephone to Trump last week, had said he hopes the United States can fairly treat Chinese companies.

""We hope that the U.S. can remove certain unilateral measures inappropriately taken against Chinese companies, in the spirit of free trade and the World Trade Organization.""

The Trump administration has accused China of failing to protect intellectual property rights, forced technology transfers and of failing to provide a level playing field for U.S. companies.

China has repeatedly promised to open its market wider to foreign investors and provide them with better services and treatment. China has also denied accusations of failing to protect intellectual property rights or of forcing foreign companies to transfer technology."

Investing.com - One week ago, we were talking about an Iranian attack on oil tankers. This week’s conversation was dominated by Iran’s downing of a U.S. drone and how President Donald Trump almost retaliated, before standing down in the final minutes. It wouldn’t be too surprising if next week brings another provocative Iran attack of some kind to push the president's button again.

As Olivier Jakob, founder of Swiss energy consultancy PetroMatrix, commented wryly on Friday: “In view of the 2020 elections, President Trump is facing a formidable challenge to address the military provocations of Iran, while avoiding a spike in gasoline prices and a correction of the stock market.”

Trump spoke of “major additional sanctions” against Iran on Saturday, before being holed up at Camp David, to plan his next move against the Islamic Republic. Last week’s 9% jump in U.S. was its biggest since Nov. 2016. 5% weekly gain was the most since the week ended Feb. 15.

On the precious metals front, bullion and futures of gold breached the magical $1,400 mark, hitting near six-year highs. With $1,500 being touted as the next target of gold bugs, some wonder if the yellow metal is better positioned than oil to benefit from the war cries in the Middle East -- as well as the Federal Reserve’s widely-expected rate cut.

Energy Review

There was no weekend short-covering for Iranian risk in the previous week despite the attack on the oil tankers. After this week though, we can't be sure that risk traders can ignore Iran anymore.

The FAA has ordered U.S. airlines to stay clear of the skies of Iran and it is likely that others will follow suit. Military escalation is a weekend risk.

As Jakob of PetroMatrix noted, the U.S. president first called out Iran on making a ""very big mistake” on the drone strike, before pinning blame on an Iranian general ""who was loose and stupid”. ""Trump clearly does not want to engage in a Middle-East war, but it will be harder and harder for the White House to leave the momentum to Iran without any U.S. response.""

Price wise, Brent's backwardation has eased further and WTI is almost out of contango despite high Cushing stocks. Gasoline has also seen strong support after a fire at the PES Philadelphia refinery.

Crude’s rally could extend into the coming week if the U.S. Energy Information Administration issues another strong dataset on crude stockpiles and gasoline demand like in the just-ended week.

Next week will be the final stretch before the July 1-2 meetings of OPEC and its key non-members’ alliance led by Russia. Typically, it is a time when OPEC ministers are most energetic in talking up oil prices. And the debate before them on extending production cuts by another six months will be rich for rhetoric.

Adding to that will be G20 in Osaka, where the star billing is Trump’s highly-anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Oil prices could also see another sharp upside if the U.S. president and his team hold, as he has promised, positive talks with China’s President Xi Jinping and negotiators from Beijing at the G20 meeting next weekend.

All these are hypothetical by the way, as a fall through in any could result in a fresh tumble in oil prices.

Precious Metals Review

Gold has been on an uptrend since the start of June, on speculation of a U.S. interest-rate cut. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve opened the door for a possible rate cut in the future, sending the yield on the benchmark Treasury note below 2% — a key psychological level — for the first time since November 2016.

Investing.com's sees a rate cut coming at the Fed's July 30-31 meeting.

Lower interest rates make safe-haven assets such as gold, which does not yield interest, more attractive while weighing on the U.S. dollar. In Friday’s session, the , measured against a basket of six currencies, hit a three-month low of 95.76.

“Should August gold climb and sustain above $1,420, my work will point to $1,445 to 1,450 as a minimum next target zone thereafter,” said Mike Paulenoff, gold commentator at MPTrader.com. “This will argue that its multi-year upside breakout will continue unabated, perhaps in reaction to the combination of an easier Fed, a weaker USD, rising inflationary expectations and heightened geopolitical tensions,” Paulenoff added.

, reflective of trades in bullion, peaked on Friday at $1,411.72, its highest since Sept. 2013. For the week, spot gold was up 4.4% while for the month, it showed a gain of 9.7%.

for August delivery, traded on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, settled Friday’s trade up $3.20, or 0.2%, at $1,400.10 per ounce. It earlier peaked at $1,414.95, its highest since Oct. 2013, when it rose to nearly $1,454. For the week, August gold was up 4.5%. For the month, it showed a gain of 10%.

Some are now talking of $1,500 levels and beyond if conflict in the Middle East reaches new heights after Thursday’s drone downing by Iran, and signs that the Fed could cut rates by 50 basis points or so by next month itself.

“$1,500 looks like the next big round target,” said Philip Streible, senior market strategist for precious metals at RJO Fututres in Chicago. “Of course, there’s a lot of stop losses out there that need to happen first.”

By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and John McCrank

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's most widely followed gauge of future stock market volatility is being manipulated, a law firm representing an ""anonymous whistleblower"" alleged in a letter to U.S. regulators seen by Reuters on Tuesday.

The accusations prompted Cboe Global Markets, the financial exchange operator that is home to the Cboe Volatility Index ( ), to ask Wall Street's self-funded regulator, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), to look into the matter, two sources familiar with the situation said.

""Cboe has a dedicated regulatory department that works with FINRA to monitor certain trading activity for our securities markets, including trading activity that could impact the VIX settlement,” Greg Hoogasian, Cboe’s chief regulatory officer, told Reuters in a statement.

The letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from Zuckerman Law, a Washington-based firm, said it had been written on behalf of a person, not identified, who had held senior roles in the investment sector.

In addition to the letter, the law firm said it had filed a formal complaint with regulators on behalf of the unidentified client. It was not clear from the letter and a redacted copy of the complaint seen by Reuters what evidence the person might have provided to support claims of manipulation.

The complaint says regulators should look at trading data for proof of alleged manipulation.

The letter, dated Monday, alleged that trading firms had taken advantage of the way the VIX is calculated in order to manipulate the index, costing investors nearly $2 billion a year.

Financial products that seek to track the VIX are at the center of recent stock market turbulence.

The VIX estimates the expected near-term volatility conveyed by S&P 500 ( ) index option prices. The CBOE calculates an official settlement monthly that determines whether large blocks of VIX futures expire worthless or turn a profit.

The whistleblower's letter alleges a flaw in the calculation of the VIX that allows trading firms to manipulate the VIX index by posting quotes for S&P 500 options, without actually trading.

Cboe spokeswoman Suzanne Cosgrove said in a statement, ""This letter is replete with inaccurate statements, misconceptions and factual errors, including a fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between the VIX Index, VIX futures and volatility exchange traded products, among other things.""

The SEC and CFTC declined to comment.

William Speth, vice president and head of research at Cboe, said, ""There are structural safeguards built into the process of the calculation of the VIX settlement value that would hinder the type of manipulation the letter alleges.""

""Our regulatory group actively surveils for potential VIX settlement manipulation,"" he said.

CLAIMS NOT NEW

Last year John Griffin and Amin Shams of the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas, Austin wrote a paper noting significant spikes in trading volume in S&P 500 index options at the exact time of the monthly VIX settlement.

The complaint alleging manipulation referenced the paper.

""It's exactly what we talked about in our paper,"" Griffin told Reuters. ""I would think the Cboe would want to redesign the settlement process to make it fairer and more transparent.""

Cboe disagreed with the paper's conclusions when it was posted on a website for research and said the jump in activity around settlement was due to investors adjusting their positions around contract expirations.

Cboe's Speth said that traders posting quotes on SPX options have to keep them open for 10 minutes and could be forced to complete the trade.

""And in a world were microseconds count, that's an eternity,"" he said.

Stuart John Barton, portfolio manager at Invest In Vol, a volatility-focused registered investment advisor in Stamford, Connecticut, said, ""There has been a longstanding understanding that there is a potential for the manipulation of the index level.""

Barton said that losses to investors from such manipulations are probably much smaller than the nearly $2 billion annually alleged in the letter.

The letter alleged that manipulation of the volatility index also played a role in last week's market turmoil where VIX-related exchange traded products (ETP) experienced big price swings.

Both Barton and Griffon cautioned that it was unlikely the type of manipulation alleged in the letter could have caused such a large spike in VIX futures.

""It would be scaremongering to say that it had a big impact on the reason why these products blew up,"" Barton said.

By Noel Randewich

(Reuters) - Wall Street climbed on Tuesday for a third straight session, buoyed by Amazon.com and Apple, while investors focused on inflation data on Wednesday that could upset the market's fragile recovery - or clear the way for additional gains.

Amazon.com (O: ) rose 2 percent while Apple (O: ) added 1 percent, both helping the S&P 500 shake off a negative open to the session and climb 0.26 percent by the close.

Investors said data on U.S. consumer prices and retail sales due out on Wednesday will be key to where stocks move in the short term. Inflation and interest-rate fears sparked a stock market rout after U.S. jobs data was released on Feb. 2.

Rob Haworth, a senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said the market's recovery from a negative start earlier in the session was a good sign, but that it remained too soon to predict the market's return to stability.

""We think we're going to be volatile for a few more trading days at least, as the market sorts out what’s really been going on,"" Haworth said.

Among the biggest movers was sportswear retailer Under Armour (N: ), up more than 17.36 percent on strong quarterly sales, and AmerisourceBergen (N: ), up 9.30 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported Walgreens (O: ) was seeking to buy out the drug distributor.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, a voting member in the central bank's rate-setting committee this year, said the recent stock market sell-off and jump in volatility will not damage the economy's overall strong prospects.

Following a slump into correction territory last week, the S&P 500 has recovered 3.2 percent in the past three session. It remains down 7.3 percent from a record high on Jan 26 and is currently priced at levels first reached in early December.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) rose 0.16 percent to end at 24,640.45 points, while the S&P 500 ( ) gained 6.94 points to close at 2,662.94.

The Nasdaq Composite ( ) added 0.45 percent to 7,013.51.

Nine of the 11 major S&P indexes rose, led by real estate , up 0.54 percent.

Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields ( ) dipped to 2.842 percent, shy of a four-year peak of 2.9020 percent hit on Monday.

The CBOE Volatility Index ( ), a widely-followed measure of short-term stock volatility and seen as a contributing factor itself to the sell-off, was last at 25.3 points, half the 50-point mark it touched last week.

Following Wall Street's recent swings, the S&P 500 is down 0.4 percent for the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 1.6 percent in 2018.

On a day of heavy trading in healthcare companies, Henry Schein (O: ) and Patterson Companies (O: ) fell 6.64 percent and 5.19 percent, respectively, after news of a U.S. Federal Trade Commission complaint against the dental supply firms.

Investors in those and other healthcare distributors are weighing the possible ramifications of the AmerisourceBergen deal and a report of Amazon's (O: ) push into the sector.

Of the 70 percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings, nearly 78 percent of them topped profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. That is above the 72 percent average beat-rate in the past four quarters.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.31-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.48-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Investing.com – Wall Street closed higher as upbeat earnings from corporates aided the recovery in US stocks from their worst weekly slump in two years ahead of a crucial inflation report.

The closed higher at 24640.45. The closed 0.26% higher, while the closed at 7013.51, up 0.45%.

Investors cheered better-than-estimated earnings from PepsiCo (NASDAQ: ) and Under Armour, with the latter, in particular, revealing a surprisingly positive quarterly performance.

Under Armour Inc C (NYSE: ) reported of $1.36 billion, up 5% from the prior year period, and ahead of the $1.3 billion analysts had forecast.

Financials, mostly banks, also lifted the broader market, as traders awaited a crucial consumer price index update, which could either justify or dent the recent move in US bond yields, potentially triggering an aggressive move in equity markets as was witnessed last week.

Investor expectations for a faster pace of inflation has grown in recent weeks amid bullish CPI data in January and an uptick in wage growth reflected in the nonfarm payrolls report. A softer CPI report on Wednesday, however, could lead many to question whether investor expectations for a faster pace of price increases were premature.

On the corporate earnings front, investors look ahead to an earnings report from, Baidu Inc (NASDAQ: ), HubSpot Inc (NYSE: ) Twilio Inc (NYSE: ), among others after US markets close.

The Dow Jones posted its first three-day winning streak in more than month as the explosive turn in volatility which characterised last week massive selloff faded somewhat as the so-called fear index continued to trickle lower, well below last week’s 50.3 level.

That’s the message from Ashmore Group, which says the recent global selloff has led to better valuations in an asset class that’s already benefiting from strong inflows and an improving growth outlook.

Historically, the larger a VIX spike, the bigger the immediate plunge in emerging-market equities. A year later, though, it usually marked the right time to buy: 12-month returns after the five biggest volatility surges in the past decade have averaged 38 percent. Rarely has a VIX spike led to any lasting negative repercussions for developing nations, said Jan Dehn, Ashmore’s head of research.

""A strategy of buying EM during risk-off episodes means entering the asset class at a time when markets are overreacting to the downside,"" he wrote in a note Tuesday.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse (S: ) has been questioned by the U.S. markets watchdog about the volatility fund that the Swiss bank is terminating after its value plunged, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission called Credit Suisse last Tuesday, the day after the market rout that prompted the bank to announce liquidation of its VelocityShares (P: ) product, the paper said.

The agency questioned the bank about the product, the Journal wrote, citing two unidentified sources. Regulatory officials asked how the investment's performance was calculated and whether retail investors were involved, it quoted one of the sources as saying.

Credit Suisse declined to comment on the report.

Switzerland's Financial Market Supervisory Authority said last week that it was in contact with Credit Suisse regarding the product launched in 2010.

Credit Suisse has said it would shut down its VelocityShares Daily Inverse Short-Term Exchange-Traded Note (ETN) -- the second-largest publicly traded product betting on future swings in the -- on Feb. 21.

Financials rose sharply, lifting the broader indexes higher, amid expectations for tighter monetary policy and ongoing recovery in inflation.

Also supporting sentiment on US equities was a fall in volatility as measured by the so-called fear index , which last week rose to its highest level since 2015 amid a surge in US bonds yields to four-year highs.

The rise in US bond yields was said by many to be one of the catalysts for the recent selloff, as higher bond yields are expected to go head-to-head with equities, competing for a larger chunk of investors’ portfolios.

UBS suggested, however, that equities have not yet peaked as bull markets typically end 3 to 12 months before the start of a recession, with the Federal funds rates at or near cycle peaks and the yield curve flat or inverted.

On the political front, investors cheered Monday’s release of the Budget and Infrastructure Plan from the White House. The infrastructure plan is widely expected to provide a fiscal lift to the US economy.

The infrastructure plan aims to spur $1.5 trillion in new investment by upgrading roads, airports and other public works. The plan also called for $50 billion to be invested in broadband, roads, power, and water projects.

The plan, however, is expected to meet resistance from both sides of the Congressional aisle as Republicans are wary of another big spending measure– after a $300 billion budget deal was signed last week – while Democrats claim the plan falls short of expectations concerning Federal funding.

The budget plan, meanwhile, forecasts the deficit for fiscal year 2019 to be $984 billion, an increase from the previously projected $526 billion."

By Richard Leong

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's solid rebound on Monday following a two-week roller-coaster ride preserved investors' outlook that the global economy remains on a steady growth path, analysts said.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) and other analysts pointed to a number of factors behind their upbeat global forecast including China's plan to generate high single-digit growth, Europe's re-emergence from its sovereign debt woes, and U.S. tax cuts and increased spending.

Goldman Sachs analysts said the current market turbulence poses only a ""modest"" risk to their ""optimistic"" view on the global economy. Goldman estimated the global economy was expanding at 5.2 percent in January.

""The history of market corrections during times of strong economic data suggests that this correction will more likely be short and shallow than long and protracted,"" they wrote in a research note published late Sunday.

However, analysts' optimism could wither if market turbulence persists and stock losses pile up. That would hurt consumer confidence, and slow investments and spending.

The two-week sell-off pushed the Dow and S&P 500 into the red from their record peaks, down 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent for the year, respectively as of Monday. Nasdaq clung to a 1.1 percent gain after rising as much as 8.7 percent from its all-time peak on Jan. 26.

Many analysts blamed the stock market sell-off in recent weeks on rising bond yields with 10-year Treasury yields ( ) at a four-year high, and soured bets that market volatility ( ) would stay low.

For now, analysts said a near wipe-out of stock gains in early 2018 were overdue following a blockbuster 2017 when major U.S. stock indexes produced their best annual performance since 2013.

As such, the U.S. economy is on track to grow about 3.1 percent in 2018, according to Credit Suisse (SIX: ), following the budget deal last week.

""The economy is growing at the fastest pace of the recovery, enhanced by tax reform and the additional fiscal stimulus of the recent budget deal. Corporate earnings are surging,"" Ameriprise chief market strategist David Joy said.

On Monday, Wall Street's main indexes ( ) ( ) ( ) rose for a second straight session, recovering from a vicious sell-off that slashed $6 trillion in value from stock markets around the world.

In late U.S. trading, the Dow ended up 1.7 percent; the S&P 500 up 1.4 percent and the Nasdaq up 1.6 percent. The MSCI world stock index ( ) was 1.2 percent higher.

INFLATION HOLDS KEY

As the stock market found some footing, it may not be out of the woods as investors await evidence as to whether U.S. inflation is accelerating.

A government report earlier this month showed that year-over-year wages grew 2.9 percent in January, the biggest annual increase since June 2009. The pickup in salary growth has stoked bets the Federal Reserve may raise key overnight borrowing costs faster to keep inflation in check.

The Labor Department will release the Consumer Price Index for January at 8:30 a.m. EST (1330 GMT) on Wednesday.

Analysts polled by Reuters expect the year-over-year increase in the government's broadest inflation gauge is likely to slow to 1.9 percent from 2.1 percent in December.

If CPI runs hotter than projection, it may fuel concerns that the Fed may raise interest rates even faster. In turn, this may send bond yields higher, triggering a fresh wave of selling in stocks that may last long enough to be a drag on the economy, analysts said.

Higher yields, a more aggressive Fed and a growing budget deficit loom as longer-term threats to the economy.

""We are optimistic about near-term growth, but it is becoming easier to envision the end of the current, near-decade long economic expansion,"" Credit Suisse economists wrote in a research note.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's three major indexes rebounded on Monday with broad-based gains as investors regained some confidence after U.S. equities' biggest weekly drop in two years, but strategists stopped short of calling an end to the market pullback.

The announcement of President Donald Trump's budget, including an infrastructure spending plan, helped sectors such as S&P materials and industrials.

But the bigger factor was likely the S&P's test and rebound from a key technical level on Friday when it briefly fell 11.8 percent from its Jan. 26 record and below its 200-day moving average during that session, according to strategists.

""Investors probably were mulling things over the weekend and concluded that the economy is fairly strong, earnings are holding up, so there’s no particular reason to panic or sell. So some money probably came back into the market,"" said John Carey, portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston.

The rose 410.37 points, or 1.7 percent, to 24,601.27, the gained 36.45 points, or 1.39 percent, to 2,656 and the added 107.47 points, or 1.56 percent, to 6,981.96.

Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co in New York, said Monday's move showed ""big, fast, money saying, 'Wait a second, buy this dip.'""

""You test the key support level and go back and test it again, which is what we did on Friday,"" he said.

But while last week's panic selling appeared to be done, strategists were not calling an end to the pullback. The S&P still closed 7.6 percent below its Jan. 26 record closing high. It confirmed a correction on Thursday, when it dropped 10 percent below the record.

Jeff Schulze, investment strategist, at Clearbridge Investments, in New York is expecting more volatility ""as the tug-of-war from short-term negative price momentum is put up against the long-term fundamentals.""

He said ""the long-term fundamentals will win out, but I think volatility will also be part of that equation.”

All the S&P 500's major 11 sectors rose, though bond-proxy sectors real estate, utilities and telecommunications services underperformed as investors monitored rising interest rates after U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hit a new four-year high of 2.902 earlier in the day.

The S&P materials sector was the biggest percentage gainer with a 2.1 percent rise followed by a 1.8 percent gain in information technology

Stocks were helped a little by Trump's budget proposal for fiscal 2019, which includes $200 billion for infrastructure spending, more than $23 billion for border security and immigration enforcement, as well as $716 billion for military programs, including the U.S. nuclear arsenal.

The , the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, ended down 3.45 points at 25.61, its lowest close since Feb. 2.

The market took fright after strong wage-growth data on Feb. 2 raised the specter of rising inflation and fears of accelerated interest rate hikes, which ignited a rally in bond yields and a sell-off in stocks.

The S&P's biggest boosts from single stocks came from Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ), which rose 4 percent, and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), which ended up 3.5 percent.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.80-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.90-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and eight new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 24 new highs and 43 new lows.

About 8.13 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges compared with the 8.5 billion average for the last 20 trading days."

Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co in New York, said Monday's move showed ""big, fast, money saying, 'Wait a second, buy this dip.'""

""You test the key support level and go back and test it again, which is what we did on Friday,"" he said.

But while last week's panic selling appeared to be done, strategists were not calling an end to the pullback. The S&P still closed 7.6 percent below its Jan. 26 record closing high. It confirmed a correction on Thursday, when it dropped 10 percent below the record.

Jeff Schulze, investment strategist, at Clearbridge Investments, in New York is expecting more volatility ""as the tug-of-war from short-term negative price momentum is put up against the long-term fundamentals.""

He said ""the long-term fundamentals will win out, but I think volatility will also be part of that equation.”

All the S&P 500's major 11 sectors rose, though bond-proxy sectors real estate, utilities and telecommunications services underperformed as investors monitored rising interest rates after U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hit a new four-year high of 2.902 earlier in the day.

The S&P materials sector was the biggest percentage gainer with a 2.1 percent rise followed by a 1.8 percent gain in information technology

Stocks were helped a little by Trump's budget proposal for fiscal 2019, which includes $200 billion for infrastructure spending, more than $23 billion for border security and immigration enforcement, as well as $716 billion for military programs, including the U.S. nuclear arsenal.

The , the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, ended down 3.45 points at 25.61, its lowest close since Feb. 2.

The market took fright after strong wage-growth data on Feb. 2 raised the specter of rising inflation and fears of accelerated interest rate hikes, which ignited a rally in bond yields and a sell-off in stocks.

The S&P's biggest boosts from single stocks came from Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ), which rose 4 percent, and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), which ended up 3.5 percent.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.80-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.90-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and eight new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 24 new highs and 43 new lows.

Investing.com - Market watchers will be looking ahead to a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping this week amid hopes for a thaw in trade relations, even if it alters expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.

A line-up of Fed speakers, as well as fresh economic data and earnings will also command investors’ attention. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

1. G20 Meeting

Trump announced last week that he would hold an “extended meeting” with Xi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan. The two-day summit gets underway on Friday.

Negotiations between Washington and Beijing broke down in early May after Trump accused China of retreating from previous commitments, causing a market sell-off.

Trump then slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatened to impose tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods, a scenario that Goldman Sachs says could sink equity markets as much as 4%.

""The best the market can expect out of the G20 is a handshake and a commitment to resume talking,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri.

This could be enough to pep up the trade-weary market while anything less could cause the market to nosedive.

2. Fed Speakers

Appearances this week by several Fed policymakers will be closely watched after the U.S. central bank indicated last week that it could cut interest rates to offset global economic uncertainties and subdued inflation.

Fed Chairman will discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, in New York on Tuesday.

New York Fed head John Williams and St Louis Fed President James Bullard are both due to speak the same day. Bullard the Fed’s decision to keep rates on hold last week, instead favoring a quarter percentage point rate cut.

One uncertainty investors face is whether positive Trump-Xi talks could delay a Fed rate cut.

U.S. economic growth, while slowing, is strong enough that ""the Fed can afford to wait a while"" to monitor trade-talk progress, Wells Fargo's Christopher said.

But if investors have to weigh a trade de-escalation with the possibility of fewer-than-hoped-for rate cuts, they will likely recognize ""that a trade deal is a more powerful boost to U.S. growth than Fed cuts,"" said Manulife's Donald.

3. U.S. Economic Data

Some key U.S. economic reports this week include the release of data on Wednesday along with figures on international trade.

Investors will also get an update on the health of the U.S. housing market from reports on , and the .

The week will also bring the final reading on first-quarter gross domestic product, with the consensus forecast for an unrevised reading of .

4. Euro Zone Inflation

Friday’s euro zone will tell whether European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was right to warn that more monetary easing would come unless prices started rising faster.

Inflation has undershot the ECB's near 2% target since 2013. The rate was 1.2% in May. The bank is worried, but it is a dilemma shared by policymakers in many countries, not least the U.S. and Japan.

But Draghi's words have made a mark. A closely-tracked key market inflation gauge -- the five-year, five-year break even forward -- has shot up to 1.3%, having languished at record lows at around 1.12% ahead of Tuesday's speech.

Economists say ""real economy"" indicators, wages, for instance, paint a less pessimistic inflation outlook, raising questions about whether Draghi's reaction to market-based inflation measures is warranted.

5. Earnings to Watch

Homebuilder Lennar (NYSE: ) is due to report before the open on Tuesday, while KB Home (NYSE: ) is set to release its earnings report a day later.

The world’s largest package shipment company, FedEx (NYSE: ) will report Q4 earnings after the close on Tuesday, amid concerns about its business being hit by the lingering China-U.S. trade dispute and slowing global growth.

On Thursday, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: ) is set to report ahead of the open, while sportswear powerhouse Nike (NYSE: ) will report after the close.

Constellation Brands (NYSE: ), the brewer of popular beer brand Corona, is set to report on Friday before the market open.

By Kevin Yao and Ben Blanchard

BEIJING (Reuters) - Both China and the United States should make compromises in trade talks, Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said on Monday, ahead of a much anticipated meeting between the Chinese and U.S. presidents at this week's G20 summit in Japan.

China and the United States last week said they were reviving talks ahead of the meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. Hopes that it will lead to a de-escalation of a trade war that is damaging the global economy has cheered financial markets.

Talks to reach a broad deal broke down last month after U.S. officials accused China of backing away from previously agreed commitments.

Speaking at a news briefing on the G20 summit, Wang, who is also part of the trade negotiating team with the United States, said talks between the two countries' trade teams were underway, though he gave no details.

China's principles are clear, he said - mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and meeting each other halfway.

""Mutual respect means each side must respect the other's sovereignty,"" Wang said.

""Equality and mutual benefit means the consultations have to happen on an equal basis, the agreement to be reached has to be beneficial for both sides,"" he said.

""Meeting each other half way means both sides have to compromise and make concessions, not just one side.""

Wang declined to answer a question about what specific compromises Xi may offer to win a trade deal with Trump.

Both the Chinese and U.S. teams are making preparations for the Xi-Trump meeting, Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Jun told the same briefing, again without offering details.

The two countries are in the middle of a costly trade dispute and have slapped increasingly severe tariffs on each other's imports. China has vowed to not give in on issues of principle nor under U.S. pressure.

Trump has threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion of goods, covering nearly all the remaining Chinese imports into the United States, including consumer products such as cellphones, computers and clothing.

RISING ECONOMIC RISKS

Wang said rising protectionism has dampened global trade and posed a threat to the global economy, while Chen Yulu, a vice governor of China's central bank, warned that global economic and financial risks are rising significantly.

""Signs of reversing monetary policy in major developed countries are becoming more evident,"" Chen told the same briefing.

""At the same time, policy room of many countries after the crisis has been reduced and room for coping with a sharp economic slowdown is limited.""

Last week, the Federal Reserve signaled interest rate cuts beginning as early as July to cope with growing economic risks, which analysts say could increase pressure on China's central bank to ease policy to support the slowing economy.

Another problem is U.S. sanctions on Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co Inc.

Wang said that Xi, when speaking by telephone to Trump last week, had said he hopes the United States can fairly treat Chinese companies.

""We hope that the U.S. can remove certain unilateral measures inappropriately taken against Chinese companies, in the spirit of free trade and the World Trade Organization.""

The Trump administration has accused China of failing to protect intellectual property rights, forced technology transfers and of failing to provide a level playing field for U.S. companies.

China has repeatedly promised to open its market wider to foreign investors and provide them with better services and treatment. China has also denied accusations of failing to protect intellectual property rights or of forcing foreign companies to transfer technology."

Investing.com - One week ago, we were talking about an Iranian attack on oil tankers. This week’s conversation was dominated by Iran’s downing of a U.S. drone and how President Donald Trump almost retaliated, before standing down in the final minutes. It wouldn’t be too surprising if next week brings another provocative Iran attack of some kind to push the president's button again.

As Olivier Jakob, founder of Swiss energy consultancy PetroMatrix, commented wryly on Friday: “In view of the 2020 elections, President Trump is facing a formidable challenge to address the military provocations of Iran, while avoiding a spike in gasoline prices and a correction of the stock market.”

Trump spoke of “major additional sanctions” against Iran on Saturday, before being holed up at Camp David, to plan his next move against the Islamic Republic. Last week’s 9% jump in U.S. was its biggest since Nov. 2016. 5% weekly gain was the most since the week ended Feb. 15.

On the precious metals front, bullion and futures of gold breached the magical $1,400 mark, hitting near six-year highs. With $1,500 being touted as the next target of gold bugs, some wonder if the yellow metal is better positioned than oil to benefit from the war cries in the Middle East -- as well as the Federal Reserve’s widely-expected rate cut.

Energy Review

There was no weekend short-covering for Iranian risk in the previous week despite the attack on the oil tankers. After this week though, we can't be sure that risk traders can ignore Iran anymore.

The FAA has ordered U.S. airlines to stay clear of the skies of Iran and it is likely that others will follow suit. Military escalation is a weekend risk.

As Jakob of PetroMatrix noted, the U.S. president first called out Iran on making a ""very big mistake” on the drone strike, before pinning blame on an Iranian general ""who was loose and stupid”. ""Trump clearly does not want to engage in a Middle-East war, but it will be harder and harder for the White House to leave the momentum to Iran without any U.S. response.""

Price wise, Brent's backwardation has eased further and WTI is almost out of contango despite high Cushing stocks. Gasoline has also seen strong support after a fire at the PES Philadelphia refinery.

Crude’s rally could extend into the coming week if the U.S. Energy Information Administration issues another strong dataset on crude stockpiles and gasoline demand like in the just-ended week.

Next week will be the final stretch before the July 1-2 meetings of OPEC and its key non-members’ alliance led by Russia. Typically, it is a time when OPEC ministers are most energetic in talking up oil prices. And the debate before them on extending production cuts by another six months will be rich for rhetoric.

Adding to that will be G20 in Osaka, where the star billing is Trump’s highly-anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Oil prices could also see another sharp upside if the U.S. president and his team hold, as he has promised, positive talks with China’s President Xi Jinping and negotiators from Beijing at the G20 meeting next weekend.

All these are hypothetical by the way, as a fall through in any could result in a fresh tumble in oil prices.

Precious Metals Review

Gold has been on an uptrend since the start of June, on speculation of a U.S. interest-rate cut. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve opened the door for a possible rate cut in the future, sending the yield on the benchmark Treasury note below 2% — a key psychological level — for the first time since November 2016.

Investing.com's sees a rate cut coming at the Fed's July 30-31 meeting.

Lower interest rates make safe-haven assets such as gold, which does not yield interest, more attractive while weighing on the U.S. dollar. In Friday’s session, the , measured against a basket of six currencies, hit a three-month low of 95.76.

“Should August gold climb and sustain above $1,420, my work will point to $1,445 to 1,450 as a minimum next target zone thereafter,” said Mike Paulenoff, gold commentator at MPTrader.com. “This will argue that its multi-year upside breakout will continue unabated, perhaps in reaction to the combination of an easier Fed, a weaker USD, rising inflationary expectations and heightened geopolitical tensions,” Paulenoff added.

, reflective of trades in bullion, peaked on Friday at $1,411.72, its highest since Sept. 2013. For the week, spot gold was up 4.4% while for the month, it showed a gain of 9.7%.

for August delivery, traded on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, settled Friday’s trade up $3.20, or 0.2%, at $1,400.10 per ounce. It earlier peaked at $1,414.95, its highest since Oct. 2013, when it rose to nearly $1,454. For the week, August gold was up 4.5%. For the month, it showed a gain of 10%.

Some are now talking of $1,500 levels and beyond if conflict in the Middle East reaches new heights after Thursday’s drone downing by Iran, and signs that the Fed could cut rates by 50 basis points or so by next month itself.

“$1,500 looks like the next big round target,” said Philip Streible, senior market strategist for precious metals at RJO Fututres in Chicago. “Of course, there’s a lot of stop losses out there that need to happen first.”

By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A widely followed gauge of expected near-term stock price gyrations perked up on Tuesday to a six-week high as traders took to the equity options market to pick up some protective contracts.

The Cboe Volatility Index, better known as the , was up 1.35 point at 11.51.

While the VIX, often referred to as Wall Street's ""fear index,"" is still well below its long-term average of around 20, it was on pace for its largest single-day gain in about two months.

Hopes of strong earnings, supported by a steep cut in corporate taxes, and solid global economic growth have bolstered Wall Street's optimism at the start of 2018.

On Tuesday, The raced past the 26,000 mark for the first time. The hit a record high of 2,807.54, before giving up gains.

VIX options volume jumped to 1.7 million contracts or about twice the daily average, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert. VIX options allow traders to build protection against future stock swings.

Analysts pegged the rush for protection against volatility to investors' unease with stocks' lofty heights, growing risk of government shutdown this week and news that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has subpoenaed President Donald Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon.

""I think it's probably the subpoena of Steve Bannon by the Mueller Special Counsel,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab (NYSE: ) in Austin.

""Because no one really knows what's going to come out of that, how disruptive it might be,"" he said.

Bannon has been subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury in a probe into alleged ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, partisan finger-pointing over immigration policy on Tuesday left the U.S. Congress and the White House stumbling closer to a possible federal government shutdown by the end of the week.

Regardless of why investors are anxious, it makes sense to pick up some protection, said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co.

""The real thing is that so many key indices and sectors have become really, really overextended,"" said Purves.

On Friday, the S&P 500 Index's 14-day relative strength index (RSI) hit 83.4, the highest since late 1996, according to Thomson Reuters data. An RSI above 70 indicates overbought conditions, analysts said.

""Why would you not buy some protection? No one is going to think you are stupid for doing that,"" Purves said."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The New Year rally in Asian shares petered out on Thursday due to concerns about rising U.S. protectionism, while bonds rebounded after China's regulator said a report about Beijing slowing or halting of its U.S. bond buying was possibly wrong.

fell more than 11 percent after South Korea said it was preparing a bill to ban trade in the cryptocurrency.

But European stock futures were 0.2 percent higher, portending a brighter opening for the region, with up 0.1 percent and futures up 0.2 percent.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 0.3 percent, slipping further from Tuesday's 10-year peak. Japan's finished 0.3 percent lower.

Bitcoin dropped 9.2 percent to $13,517.83 on the Bitstamp exchange, after South Korea's justice minister said a bill was being prepared to ban cryptocurrency trading.

U.S Treasuries pared some of their losses, pushing down the 10-year yield to 2.544 percent from Wednesday's ten-month high of 2.597 percent, hit after a Bloomberg report that China is considering slowing or halting purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds.

The country's foreign exchange regulator said on Thursday the report may be based on erroneous information and could be ""fake"", prompting investors to buy back bonds.

""That should have been good news for the U.S. dollar, but it's still trading very weakly - it's a weak dollar story,"" said Masashi Murata, currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo. ""The market seems to have been looking for one-sided news to sell the dollar, this week.""

Globally bonds markets had been spooked by the Bank of Japan's routine announcement on Tuesday of a reduction in purchases of longer-tenor bonds and a jump in oil prices on top of the report about China's investment in U.S. bonds.

Those factors combined to push 10-year Treasury yields to their highest levels since March, and also pressured the dollar and stock markets. The implied volatility index, the markets' so-called ""fear gauge,"" hovered just above 10 on Thursday, from as low as 8.92 on Jan. 2.

U.S. shares snapped their New Year rally on Wednesday while the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso fell after a Reuters report said Canada increasingly believes that U.S. President Donald Trump will soon announce his intention to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement treaty.

""I would think that China is flexing its muscles as the United States is looking into measures to deal with its trade deficit with China,"" said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank.

""I have been expecting rising trade frictions between the United States and China this year. It appears China is quick to touch the Achilles heel of the States,"" he added.

Reports on investigations into U.S. imports are due to be sent to Trump this month, including probes into whether imports of steel and aluminum threaten U.S. national security.

A separate probe into Chinese intellectual property practices may also conclude as early as this month, Axios reported, and could result in tariffs on the country's consumer-electronics exports.

The speculation that China may reduce its buying in U.S. bonds helped to underpin the euro, the most obvious alternative to the dollar for assets.

The euro traded at $1.1945, nearly flat on the day, and holding above Tuesday's low of $1.1916.

Against the yen, the dollar added 0.4 percent to 111.83, after hitting a six-week low of 111.27 yen in the previous session when it skidded 1.1 percent to mark its largest decline in almost eight months.

The yen was buoyed this week after a cut in the Bank of Japan's bond buying on Tuesday fueled speculation that the central bank could eventually seek to exit from its stimulus later this year, following in the footsteps of other major central banks.

The BOJ maintained the amount of its bond purchases on Thursday, helping to soothe a market rattled by its reduction earlier this week.

The Canadian dollar traded at C$1.2554 per U.S. dollar after having lost 0.7 percent on Wednesday.

prices jumped on Wednesday and settled near three-year highs after U.S. government data showed a drop in crude inventories and production, though the fall in the latter could be the result of extreme cold temperatures across the United States.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures traded at $63.47 per barrel, down 10 cents, after hitting a high of $63.67 in the previous session, their loftiest level since December 2014.

futures traded at $69.03 a barrel, down 17 cents, after rising as high as $69.37 on Wednesday, highest since May 2015.

Investing.com - Market watchers will be looking ahead to a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping this week amid hopes for a thaw in trade relations, even if it alters expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.

A line-up of Fed speakers, as well as fresh economic data and earnings will also command investors’ attention. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

1. G20 Meeting

Trump announced last week that he would hold an “extended meeting” with Xi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan. The two-day summit gets underway on Friday.

Negotiations between Washington and Beijing broke down in early May after Trump accused China of retreating from previous commitments, causing a market sell-off.

Trump then slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatened to impose tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods, a scenario that Goldman Sachs says could sink equity markets as much as 4%.

""The best the market can expect out of the G20 is a handshake and a commitment to resume talking,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri.

This could be enough to pep up the trade-weary market while anything less could cause the market to nosedive.

2. Fed Speakers

Appearances this week by several Fed policymakers will be closely watched after the U.S. central bank indicated last week that it could cut interest rates to offset global economic uncertainties and subdued inflation.

Fed Chairman will discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, in New York on Tuesday.

New York Fed head John Williams and St Louis Fed President James Bullard are both due to speak the same day. Bullard the Fed’s decision to keep rates on hold last week, instead favoring a quarter percentage point rate cut.

One uncertainty investors face is whether positive Trump-Xi talks could delay a Fed rate cut.

U.S. economic growth, while slowing, is strong enough that ""the Fed can afford to wait a while"" to monitor trade-talk progress, Wells Fargo's Christopher said.

But if investors have to weigh a trade de-escalation with the possibility of fewer-than-hoped-for rate cuts, they will likely recognize ""that a trade deal is a more powerful boost to U.S. growth than Fed cuts,"" said Manulife's Donald.

3. U.S. Economic Data

Some key U.S. economic reports this week include the release of data on Wednesday along with figures on international trade.

Investors will also get an update on the health of the U.S. housing market from reports on , and the .

The week will also bring the final reading on first-quarter gross domestic product, with the consensus forecast for an unrevised reading of .

4. Euro Zone Inflation

Friday’s euro zone will tell whether European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was right to warn that more monetary easing would come unless prices started rising faster.

Inflation has undershot the ECB's near 2% target since 2013. The rate was 1.2% in May. The bank is worried, but it is a dilemma shared by policymakers in many countries, not least the U.S. and Japan.

But Draghi's words have made a mark. A closely-tracked key market inflation gauge -- the five-year, five-year break even forward -- has shot up to 1.3%, having languished at record lows at around 1.12% ahead of Tuesday's speech.

Economists say ""real economy"" indicators, wages, for instance, paint a less pessimistic inflation outlook, raising questions about whether Draghi's reaction to market-based inflation measures is warranted.

5. Earnings to Watch

Homebuilder Lennar (NYSE: ) is due to report before the open on Tuesday, while KB Home (NYSE: ) is set to release its earnings report a day later.

The world’s largest package shipment company, FedEx (NYSE: ) will report Q4 earnings after the close on Tuesday, amid concerns about its business being hit by the lingering China-U.S. trade dispute and slowing global growth.

On Thursday, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: ) is set to report ahead of the open, while sportswear powerhouse Nike (NYSE: ) will report after the close.

Constellation Brands (NYSE: ), the brewer of popular beer brand Corona, is set to report on Friday before the market open.

By Kevin Yao and Ben Blanchard

BEIJING (Reuters) - Both China and the United States should make compromises in trade talks, Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said on Monday, ahead of a much anticipated meeting between the Chinese and U.S. presidents at this week's G20 summit in Japan.

China and the United States last week said they were reviving talks ahead of the meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. Hopes that it will lead to a de-escalation of a trade war that is damaging the global economy has cheered financial markets.

Talks to reach a broad deal broke down last month after U.S. officials accused China of backing away from previously agreed commitments.

Speaking at a news briefing on the G20 summit, Wang, who is also part of the trade negotiating team with the United States, said talks between the two countries' trade teams were underway, though he gave no details.

China's principles are clear, he said - mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and meeting each other halfway.

""Mutual respect means each side must respect the other's sovereignty,"" Wang said.

""Equality and mutual benefit means the consultations have to happen on an equal basis, the agreement to be reached has to be beneficial for both sides,"" he said.

""Meeting each other half way means both sides have to compromise and make concessions, not just one side.""

Wang declined to answer a question about what specific compromises Xi may offer to win a trade deal with Trump.

Both the Chinese and U.S. teams are making preparations for the Xi-Trump meeting, Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Jun told the same briefing, again without offering details.

The two countries are in the middle of a costly trade dispute and have slapped increasingly severe tariffs on each other's imports. China has vowed to not give in on issues of principle nor under U.S. pressure.

Trump has threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion of goods, covering nearly all the remaining Chinese imports into the United States, including consumer products such as cellphones, computers and clothing.

RISING ECONOMIC RISKS

Wang said rising protectionism has dampened global trade and posed a threat to the global economy, while Chen Yulu, a vice governor of China's central bank, warned that global economic and financial risks are rising significantly.

""Signs of reversing monetary policy in major developed countries are becoming more evident,"" Chen told the same briefing.

""At the same time, policy room of many countries after the crisis has been reduced and room for coping with a sharp economic slowdown is limited.""

Last week, the Federal Reserve signaled interest rate cuts beginning as early as July to cope with growing economic risks, which analysts say could increase pressure on China's central bank to ease policy to support the slowing economy.

Another problem is U.S. sanctions on Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co Inc.

Wang said that Xi, when speaking by telephone to Trump last week, had said he hopes the United States can fairly treat Chinese companies.

""We hope that the U.S. can remove certain unilateral measures inappropriately taken against Chinese companies, in the spirit of free trade and the World Trade Organization.""

The Trump administration has accused China of failing to protect intellectual property rights, forced technology transfers and of failing to provide a level playing field for U.S. companies.

China has repeatedly promised to open its market wider to foreign investors and provide them with better services and treatment. China has also denied accusations of failing to protect intellectual property rights or of forcing foreign companies to transfer technology."

Investing.com - One week ago, we were talking about an Iranian attack on oil tankers. This week’s conversation was dominated by Iran’s downing of a U.S. drone and how President Donald Trump almost retaliated, before standing down in the final minutes. It wouldn’t be too surprising if next week brings another provocative Iran attack of some kind to push the president's button again.

As Olivier Jakob, founder of Swiss energy consultancy PetroMatrix, commented wryly on Friday: “In view of the 2020 elections, President Trump is facing a formidable challenge to address the military provocations of Iran, while avoiding a spike in gasoline prices and a correction of the stock market.”

Trump spoke of “major additional sanctions” against Iran on Saturday, before being holed up at Camp David, to plan his next move against the Islamic Republic. Last week’s 9% jump in U.S. was its biggest since Nov. 2016. 5% weekly gain was the most since the week ended Feb. 15.

On the precious metals front, bullion and futures of gold breached the magical $1,400 mark, hitting near six-year highs. With $1,500 being touted as the next target of gold bugs, some wonder if the yellow metal is better positioned than oil to benefit from the war cries in the Middle East -- as well as the Federal Reserve’s widely-expected rate cut.

Energy Review

There was no weekend short-covering for Iranian risk in the previous week despite the attack on the oil tankers. After this week though, we can't be sure that risk traders can ignore Iran anymore.

The FAA has ordered U.S. airlines to stay clear of the skies of Iran and it is likely that others will follow suit. Military escalation is a weekend risk.

As Jakob of PetroMatrix noted, the U.S. president first called out Iran on making a ""very big mistake” on the drone strike, before pinning blame on an Iranian general ""who was loose and stupid”. ""Trump clearly does not want to engage in a Middle-East war, but it will be harder and harder for the White House to leave the momentum to Iran without any U.S. response.""

Price wise, Brent's backwardation has eased further and WTI is almost out of contango despite high Cushing stocks. Gasoline has also seen strong support after a fire at the PES Philadelphia refinery.

Crude’s rally could extend into the coming week if the U.S. Energy Information Administration issues another strong dataset on crude stockpiles and gasoline demand like in the just-ended week.

Next week will be the final stretch before the July 1-2 meetings of OPEC and its key non-members’ alliance led by Russia. Typically, it is a time when OPEC ministers are most energetic in talking up oil prices. And the debate before them on extending production cuts by another six months will be rich for rhetoric.

Adding to that will be G20 in Osaka, where the star billing is Trump’s highly-anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Oil prices could also see another sharp upside if the U.S. president and his team hold, as he has promised, positive talks with China’s President Xi Jinping and negotiators from Beijing at the G20 meeting next weekend.

All these are hypothetical by the way, as a fall through in any could result in a fresh tumble in oil prices.

Precious Metals Review

Gold has been on an uptrend since the start of June, on speculation of a U.S. interest-rate cut. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve opened the door for a possible rate cut in the future, sending the yield on the benchmark Treasury note below 2% — a key psychological level — for the first time since November 2016.

Investing.com's sees a rate cut coming at the Fed's July 30-31 meeting.

Lower interest rates make safe-haven assets such as gold, which does not yield interest, more attractive while weighing on the U.S. dollar. In Friday’s session, the , measured against a basket of six currencies, hit a three-month low of 95.76.

“Should August gold climb and sustain above $1,420, my work will point to $1,445 to 1,450 as a minimum next target zone thereafter,” said Mike Paulenoff, gold commentator at MPTrader.com. “This will argue that its multi-year upside breakout will continue unabated, perhaps in reaction to the combination of an easier Fed, a weaker USD, rising inflationary expectations and heightened geopolitical tensions,” Paulenoff added.

, reflective of trades in bullion, peaked on Friday at $1,411.72, its highest since Sept. 2013. For the week, spot gold was up 4.4% while for the month, it showed a gain of 9.7%.

for August delivery, traded on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, settled Friday’s trade up $3.20, or 0.2%, at $1,400.10 per ounce. It earlier peaked at $1,414.95, its highest since Oct. 2013, when it rose to nearly $1,454. For the week, August gold was up 4.5%. For the month, it showed a gain of 10%.

Some are now talking of $1,500 levels and beyond if conflict in the Middle East reaches new heights after Thursday’s drone downing by Iran, and signs that the Fed could cut rates by 50 basis points or so by next month itself.

“$1,500 looks like the next big round target,” said Philip Streible, senior market strategist for precious metals at RJO Fututres in Chicago. “Of course, there’s a lot of stop losses out there that need to happen first.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 eased on Friday, ending a six-day run of record highs as the first monthly decline in U.S. nonfarm jobs in seven years dampened sentiment and pharmacy shares fell on Amazon competition fears.

The Nasdaq ended up for a ninth straight day, however, and set its sixth straight record high close, its longest such streak since seven records in February.

Walgreens Boots Alliance (O: ) and CVS Health (N: ) fell and were among the biggest drags on the S&P 500 after a CNBC report that Amazon (O: ) was close to a decision on selling prescription drugs. Walgreens shares dropped 4.9 percent and CVS was down 4.9 percent, while Amazon shares rose 0.9 percent.

The Labor Department's closely watched jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls fell by 33,000 in September as hurricanes Harvey and Irma left displaced workers temporarily unemployed and delayed hiring. A bright spot was a better-than-expected rise in average wages.

""It's been amazing how resilient our U.S. stock market has been, going up on no news or bad news, so there's no surprise on a day where most people feel it was a mixed jobs report at best that the market actually is reacting in a way that makes sense,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

""It's a logical move for this illogical stock market.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) fell 1.72 points, or 0.01 percent, to end at 22,773.67, the S&P 500 ( ) lost 2.74 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,549.33 and the Nasdaq Composite ( ) added 4.82 points, or 0.07 percent, to 6,590.18.

The benchmark's slight decline follow a six-day run of record closing highs, its longest since 1997.

The CBOE Volatility index ( ), Wall Street's fear gauge, bounced sharply after setting a record low close in the previous session.

For the week, the S&P 500 rose 1.2 percent, the Dow added 1.6 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1.5 percent.

Adding to the day's worries was a report that North Korea is preparing to test a long-range missile.

S&P energy index ( ) declined 0.8 percent as oil prices ( ) ( ) fell amid a bout of profit taking and the return of oversupply worries.

Shares of Costco (O: ) dropped 6 percent after the warehouse club retailer reported a fall in gross margins. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.74-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.11-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

About 5.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 6.2 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data."

By Caroline Valetkevitch

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A more than eight-year bull market on Wall Street will simmer for the rest of 2017 before picking up again next year, said strategists in a Reuters poll who were optimistic about corporate profits but concerned about slow tax reform progress.

The benchmark S&P 500 ( ) is likely to finish this year at 2,525, about 13 percent above 2016's end, but 0.4 percent down from Tuesday's close of 2,534.58, based on the median forecast of 47 strategists polled by Reuters.

After strong third-quarter gains fueled in part by U.S. President Donald Trump's recent proposals for the biggest federal tax overhaul in three decades, the index is trading at a record, already above the median forecast from a June Reuters poll of 2,460.

The median S&P 500 forecast in the poll for end-2018 was 2,675.

""The economy and earnings are pretty good, and they're the building blocks. That's what's given us the good year-to-date (gains) and could continue to cause those of us who think stocks are OK but not great to be too cautious,"" said Robert Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management in Princeton, New Jersey. He has a 2,550 year-end target for the S&P 500.

Recent hurricanes in the United States curbed some consumer spending in August but accounted somewhat for a surge in a measure of U.S. manufacturing activity to a near 13-1/2-year high in September.

Other data showed new orders for U.S.-made capital goods increased more than expected in August.

How long the bull run lasts will depend also on the Federal Reserve, whose accommodative monetary policy has helped fuel the market's rally in recent years, and whether the U.S. economy can keep growing as the Fed hikes U.S. interest rates further.

Last month the Fed signaled it expects one more rate hike by the end of the year but said it was closely watching inflation. If inflation stays low, that could mean a less aggressive Fed, analysts said.

Investors also face the prospect of a new Fed chief early next year. Chair Janet Yellen, whose term expires in February, is among several under consideration for the job.

While investors have cheered Trump's proposed tax reform, the plan is only in its early stages, and already has prompted criticism, including that it could add trillions of dollars to the deficit.

""There are a lot of details that need to be worked out,"" said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri. Wells Fargo has a 2017 target of 2,350 for the S&P 500 and a 2018 target of 2,500.

Republicans so far have been unable to produce any major legislative successes since Trump took office in January, despite controlling the White House and both Houses of Congress.

Strategists expect companies' profit growth to help justify lofty valuations and sustain gains in stocks. Analysts forecast a year-over-year earnings gain of 11.5 percent for the S&P 500 in 2017 and growth of another 11.1 percent in 2018, Thomson Reuters data shows.

The S&P 500 is trading at about 18 times expected earnings over the next year, well above its long-term average of about 15.

Among sectors, technology remains a favorite pick for many strategists. The S&P 500 technology index ( ) has far outpaced gains in the broader market, and as of Tuesday was up about 26 percent for the year so far.

Many strategists in the poll said they expected the market's recent lack of volatility to continue for at least the near term. They largely id not see the CBOE Volatility index ( ) rising to historically normal levels for at least another three to six months.

Investing.com - Market watchers will be looking ahead to a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping this week amid hopes for a thaw in trade relations, even if it alters expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.

A line-up of Fed speakers, as well as fresh economic data and earnings will also command investors’ attention. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

1. G20 Meeting

Trump announced last week that he would hold an “extended meeting” with Xi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan. The two-day summit gets underway on Friday.

Negotiations between Washington and Beijing broke down in early May after Trump accused China of retreating from previous commitments, causing a market sell-off.

Trump then slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatened to impose tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods, a scenario that Goldman Sachs says could sink equity markets as much as 4%.

""The best the market can expect out of the G20 is a handshake and a commitment to resume talking,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri.

This could be enough to pep up the trade-weary market while anything less could cause the market to nosedive.

2. Fed Speakers

Appearances this week by several Fed policymakers will be closely watched after the U.S. central bank indicated last week that it could cut interest rates to offset global economic uncertainties and subdued inflation.

Fed Chairman will discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, in New York on Tuesday.

New York Fed head John Williams and St Louis Fed President James Bullard are both due to speak the same day. Bullard the Fed’s decision to keep rates on hold last week, instead favoring a quarter percentage point rate cut.

One uncertainty investors face is whether positive Trump-Xi talks could delay a Fed rate cut.

U.S. economic growth, while slowing, is strong enough that ""the Fed can afford to wait a while"" to monitor trade-talk progress, Wells Fargo's Christopher said.

But if investors have to weigh a trade de-escalation with the possibility of fewer-than-hoped-for rate cuts, they will likely recognize ""that a trade deal is a more powerful boost to U.S. growth than Fed cuts,"" said Manulife's Donald.

3. U.S. Economic Data

Some key U.S. economic reports this week include the release of data on Wednesday along with figures on international trade.

Investors will also get an update on the health of the U.S. housing market from reports on , and the .

The week will also bring the final reading on first-quarter gross domestic product, with the consensus forecast for an unrevised reading of .

4. Euro Zone Inflation

Friday’s euro zone will tell whether European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was right to warn that more monetary easing would come unless prices started rising faster.

Inflation has undershot the ECB's near 2% target since 2013. The rate was 1.2% in May. The bank is worried, but it is a dilemma shared by policymakers in many countries, not least the U.S. and Japan.

But Draghi's words have made a mark. A closely-tracked key market inflation gauge -- the five-year, five-year break even forward -- has shot up to 1.3%, having languished at record lows at around 1.12% ahead of Tuesday's speech.

Economists say ""real economy"" indicators, wages, for instance, paint a less pessimistic inflation outlook, raising questions about whether Draghi's reaction to market-based inflation measures is warranted.

5. Earnings to Watch

Homebuilder Lennar (NYSE: ) is due to report before the open on Tuesday, while KB Home (NYSE: ) is set to release its earnings report a day later.

The world’s largest package shipment company, FedEx (NYSE: ) will report Q4 earnings after the close on Tuesday, amid concerns about its business being hit by the lingering China-U.S. trade dispute and slowing global growth.

On Thursday, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: ) is set to report ahead of the open, while sportswear powerhouse Nike (NYSE: ) will report after the close.

Constellation Brands (NYSE: ), the brewer of popular beer brand Corona, is set to report on Friday before the market open.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Both China and the United States should make compromises in trade talks, Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said on Monday, ahead of a much anticipated meeting between the Chinese and U.S. presidents at this week's G20 summit in Japan.

China and the United States last week said they were reviving talks ahead of the meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. Hopes that it will lead to a de-escalation of a trade war that is damaging the global economy has cheered financial markets.

Talks to reach a broad deal broke down last month after U.S. officials accused China of backing away from previously agreed commitments.

Speaking at a news briefing on the G20 summit, Wang, who is also part of the trade negotiating team with the United States, said talks between the two countries' trade teams were underway, though he gave no details.

China's principles are clear, he said - mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and meeting each other halfway.

""Mutual respect means each side must respect the other's sovereignty,"" Wang said.

""Equality and mutual benefit means the consultations have to happen on an equal basis, the agreement to be reached has to be beneficial for both sides,"" he said.

""Meeting each other half way means both sides have to compromise and make concessions, not just one side.""

Wang declined to answer a question about what specific compromises Xi may offer to win a trade deal with Trump.

Both the Chinese and U.S. teams are making preparations for the Xi-Trump meeting, Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Jun told the same briefing, again without offering details.

The two countries are in the middle of a costly trade dispute and have slapped increasingly severe tariffs on each other's imports. China has vowed to not give in on issues of principle nor under U.S. pressure.

Trump has threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion of goods, covering nearly all the remaining Chinese imports into the United States, including consumer products such as cellphones, computers and clothing.

RISING ECONOMIC RISKS

Wang said rising protectionism has dampened global trade and posed a threat to the global economy, while Chen Yulu, a vice governor of China's central bank, warned that global economic and financial risks are rising significantly.

""Signs of reversing monetary policy in major developed countries are becoming more evident,"" Chen told the same briefing.

""At the same time, policy room of many countries after the crisis has been reduced and room for coping with a sharp economic slowdown is limited.""

Last week, the Federal Reserve signaled interest rate cuts beginning as early as July to cope with growing economic risks, which analysts say could increase pressure on China's central bank to ease policy to support the slowing economy.

Another problem is U.S. sanctions on Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co Inc.

Wang said that Xi, when speaking by telephone to Trump last week, had said he hopes the United States can fairly treat Chinese companies.

""We hope that the U.S. can remove certain unilateral measures inappropriately taken against Chinese companies, in the spirit of free trade and the World Trade Organization.""

The Trump administration has accused China of failing to protect intellectual property rights, forced technology transfers and of failing to provide a level playing field for U.S. companies.

China has repeatedly promised to open its market wider to foreign investors and provide them with better services and treatment. China has also denied accusations of failing to protect intellectual property rights or of forcing foreign companies to transfer technology."

By Barani Krishnan

Investing.com - One week ago, we were talking about an Iranian attack on oil tankers. This week’s conversation was dominated by Iran’s downing of a U.S. drone and how President Donald Trump almost retaliated, before standing down in the final minutes. It wouldn’t be too surprising if next week brings another provocative Iran attack of some kind to push the president's button again.

As Olivier Jakob, founder of Swiss energy consultancy PetroMatrix, commented wryly on Friday: “In view of the 2020 elections, President Trump is facing a formidable challenge to address the military provocations of Iran, while avoiding a spike in gasoline prices and a correction of the stock market.”

Trump spoke of “major additional sanctions” against Iran on Saturday, before being holed up at Camp David, to plan his next move against the Islamic Republic. Last week’s 9% jump in U.S. was its biggest since Nov. 2016. 5% weekly gain was the most since the week ended Feb. 15.

On the precious metals front, bullion and futures of gold breached the magical $1,400 mark, hitting near six-year highs. With $1,500 being touted as the next target of gold bugs, some wonder if the yellow metal is better positioned than oil to benefit from the war cries in the Middle East -- as well as the Federal Reserve’s widely-expected rate cut.

Energy Review

There was no weekend short-covering for Iranian risk in the previous week despite the attack on the oil tankers. After this week though, we can't be sure that risk traders can ignore Iran anymore.

The FAA has ordered U.S. airlines to stay clear of the skies of Iran and it is likely that others will follow suit. Military escalation is a weekend risk.

As Jakob of PetroMatrix noted, the U.S. president first called out Iran on making a ""very big mistake” on the drone strike, before pinning blame on an Iranian general ""who was loose and stupid”. ""Trump clearly does not want to engage in a Middle-East war, but it will be harder and harder for the White House to leave the momentum to Iran without any U.S. response.""

Price wise, Brent's backwardation has eased further and WTI is almost out of contango despite high Cushing stocks. Gasoline has also seen strong support after a fire at the PES Philadelphia refinery.

Crude’s rally could extend into the coming week if the U.S. Energy Information Administration issues another strong dataset on crude stockpiles and gasoline demand like in the just-ended week.

Next week will be the final stretch before the July 1-2 meetings of OPEC and its key non-members’ alliance led by Russia. Typically, it is a time when OPEC ministers are most energetic in talking up oil prices. And the debate before them on extending production cuts by another six months will be rich for rhetoric.

Adding to that will be G20 in Osaka, where the star billing is Trump’s highly-anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Oil prices could also see another sharp upside if the U.S. president and his team hold, as he has promised, positive talks with China’s President Xi Jinping and negotiators from Beijing at the G20 meeting next weekend.

All these are hypothetical by the way, as a fall through in any could result in a fresh tumble in oil prices.

Precious Metals Review

Gold has been on an uptrend since the start of June, on speculation of a U.S. interest-rate cut. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve opened the door for a possible rate cut in the future, sending the yield on the benchmark Treasury note below 2% — a key psychological level — for the first time since November 2016.

Investing.com's sees a rate cut coming at the Fed's July 30-31 meeting.

Lower interest rates make safe-haven assets such as gold, which does not yield interest, more attractive while weighing on the U.S. dollar. In Friday’s session, the , measured against a basket of six currencies, hit a three-month low of 95.76.

“Should August gold climb and sustain above $1,420, my work will point to $1,445 to 1,450 as a minimum next target zone thereafter,” said Mike Paulenoff, gold commentator at MPTrader.com. “This will argue that its multi-year upside breakout will continue unabated, perhaps in reaction to the combination of an easier Fed, a weaker USD, rising inflationary expectations and heightened geopolitical tensions,” Paulenoff added.

, reflective of trades in bullion, peaked on Friday at $1,411.72, its highest since Sept. 2013. For the week, spot gold was up 4.4% while for the month, it showed a gain of 9.7%.

for August delivery, traded on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, settled Friday’s trade up $3.20, or 0.2%, at $1,400.10 per ounce. It earlier peaked at $1,414.95, its highest since Oct. 2013, when it rose to nearly $1,454. For the week, August gold was up 4.5%. For the month, it showed a gain of 10%.

Some are now talking of $1,500 levels and beyond if conflict in the Middle East reaches new heights after Thursday’s drone downing by Iran, and signs that the Fed could cut rates by 50 basis points or so by next month itself.

“$1,500 looks like the next big round target,” said Philip Streible, senior market strategist for precious metals at RJO Fututres in Chicago. “Of course, there’s a lot of stop losses out there that need to happen first.”

By Saikat Chatterjee and Kit Rees

LONDON (Reuters) - Stock prices climbing ever higher as interest rates and volatility plumb rock bottom: for some of the world's top asset managers, the investment outlook is as good as it gets.

But look closer and clouds are forming that may put a dampener on this sunny outlook. Investors should beware a rise in bond yields, a downturn in economic data or a policy misstep in a large emerging market.

As the big money managers outline their recommendations for the rest of 2017, several have highlighted stocks and local currency emerging market debt as likely winners.

The reasons aren't difficult to find.

A collapse in market volatility to record lows across currencies, fixed income and equities means carry trade strategies, in which investors borrow in a low-yielding currency to invest in a higher-yielding one, have proven very rewarding.

The JPMorgan (NYSE: ) emerging market currency index is up more than 8.5 percent this year, on track for its best yearly performance since 2010, according to Thomson Reuters data.

A structural decline in inflation despite years of monetary stimulus pursued by the world's biggest central banks has also meant that holding cash or government bonds would actually leach money from portfolios.

Strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE: ) estimate inflation is rising in only 11 percent of developed markets compared with 72 percent in February.

Small wonder that some investors believe these may be the best conditions to buy equities as the biggest industrialized economies are enjoying low but persistent growth, near full-employment and declining inflation.

EARNINGS

A favorite chart with investment houses is the growing premium offered by earnings yields over bond yields. At a chunky 6 percent, it suggests investors would do well to buy stocks.

With earnings recovering and interest rates at record lows, Blackrock (NYSE: ) strategists say they see ""less reason"" to expect equity valuation metrics to fall back to historical means in such a world.

But portfolio managers such as Julian Chillingworth, CIO of Rathbone Unit Trust Management, say substantial flows into European stocks from exchange-traded funds and passive investors have pushed valuations to a point where they are beginning to look a bit stretched.

""We feel that we’ve seen some very good economic data, but wonder whether or not we may be close to a peak in this series of economic data and so consequently we could see the economy not dipping dramatically, but rolling over,"" he said.

Deutsche Bank equity strategists say the recent surge in European purchasing manager indexes (PMIs) is not supported by lending surveys or other data, suggesting economic momentum may weaken in the coming months and weigh on equities.

Fading economic momentum combined with rising bond yields would be the worst possible combination for equities as it could squeeze that gap between stock and bond yields.

German 10-year bond yields have doubled to more than 53 basis points in the last month and may rise further if the European Central Bank does more to lay the ground for the withdrawal of its policy stimulus.

POCKETS OF EXUBERANCE

Whatever the reason for their caution, investors are buying downside protection in markets even as global stock markets scale record highs.

An analysis of more than 400 global equity and European active fund holdings by Barclays (LON: ) strategists indicates conviction levels among fund managers are low and cash levels high relative to historical averages, indicating some scepticism about the sustainability of the market rally.

And portfolio managers at Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) Asset Managers pointed to a gap between the record low in the CBOE's ""fear gauge"" of implied volatility in the U.S. stocks index and its SKEW index, which indicates what investors are paying to protect themselves against the risk of a big sell-off.

""Even though implied volatility is very low, the VIX skew on the implied probability of a large move down in equity prices is historically quite high – which shows market less ‘complacent’ than you may think,"" they said.

But pockets of unabashed exuberance exist.

For example, 12-month price-to-earnings multiples in India are above 18 times, more than one standard deviation over their long-term median, indicating markets may be frothy and vulnerable if the central bank misreads inflation data and cuts interest rates aggressively, potentially fuelling a bubble.

Some parts of the global credit markets remain richly valued: a JPMorgan index of global emerging market debt trading near its lowest levels on record while Deutsche Bank (DE: ) strategists say downside protection on German stocks are at record lows.

""Investors have already made double digit returns on their portfolios this year and now is a good time to take some money off the table rather than add positions into a potentially volatile period,"" said a strategist at an Asian private bank in Hong Kong.

By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. equity options market is pricing in uncharacteristically low stock market gyrations in the early days of second quarter corporate earnings reports, offering attractive opportunities for investors, market analysts said on Wednesday.

On Wednesday, the CBOE Volatility Index ( ), better known as the VIX and the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, closed below 10 for the fifth straight day, the longest such streak since its inception.

This expectation of extended calm for stocks in the near-term flies in the face of how much stocks tend to move on earnings reports.

For example, when S&P 500 companies reported earnings during the first quarter, the average stock's one-day price move was four times greater than during non-earnings trading, according to derivatives analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ).

""Stock volatility has shifted more into the earnings report and out of non-earnings periods - yet the options market has not adjusted to reflect the increasing importance of earnings for stocks returns,"" Goldman analysts said in a note on Wednesday.

""We view this set-up as very supportive of buying options ahead of earnings.""

While subdued expectations for volatility has led to attractively priced options contracts across the board - whether investors are looking to hedge or to speculate - the pricing on contracts that profit from further gains are particularly appealing.

""The premiums on upside call options have gone very, very low and they are worth buying,"" said Pravit Chintawongvanich, head of derivatives strategy at Macro Risk Advisors in New York.

Just how cheap these options are can be gauged by their delta, a proxy for the market's implied probability that a contract will be profitable at expiry.

As of Wednesday morning, one-month S&P 500 call options that make money if the index rises above 2,500 by expiry were pricing a less than 6 percent chance of success, a record low probability, according to Chintawongvanich.

Calls convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future, while put options give the right to sell shares at a certain price in the future.

""Going by history, the probability of rallying that much should be much higher,"" Chintawongvanich said, adding the probability should have been closer to 13 percent, even in a low volatility environment.

On Wednesday, the closed at a record high of 2,473.83, taking year-to-date gains to 10.5 percent."

By Kimberly Chin

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Netflix rally boosted the Nasdaq Composite to a record high on Tuesday while Goldman Sachs Group Inc (N: ) dragged the Dow lower as earnings take center stage on Wall Street.

The Nasdaq posted its eighth consecutive session of gains, the longest streak since its 10-day string in February 2015.

The tech-heavy index was largely boosted by Netflix (O: ). The movie streaming company rose 13.5 percent to $183.60 a day after it crushed Wall Street forecasts by reporting 5.2 million new streaming customers in the second quarter.

As the second-quarter earnings season gears up, investors will put most of their focus on the performance of individual companies, analysts said.

""Earnings and guidance will move the market more than news out of D.C. Goldman is more important to the market today, as is Netflix, and that will be the case for the next couple of weeks,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.

The Dow was dragged lower by a drop in Goldman Sachs, which fell 2.6 percent to $223.31 after reporting a 40 percent fall in bond trading revenue and posted the weakest commodities results in its history as a public company.

Other widely held stocks were active after posting results.

Johnson & Johnson (N: ) gained 1.7 percent to $134.46 after saying expected sales growth to pick up in the second half of the year.

Harley-Davidson Inc (N: ) fell 5.9 percent to $48.95 after the motorcycle maker cut its forecast for 2017 shipments.

Analysts estimate an 8.5 percent rise in second-quarter earnings and a 4.7 percent increase in revenue for S&P 500 companies from a year earlier.

This follows a robust first quarter when U.S. companies posted the fastest rate of growth in earnings since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) fell 54.99 points, or 0.25 percent, to 21,574.73, the S&P 500 ( ) gained 1.47 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,460.61 and the Nasdaq Composite ( ) added 29.87 points, or 0.47 percent, to 6,344.31.

Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 set record closing highs.

The CBOE Volatility index ( ) ticked up to end at 9.89 on its fourth consecutive close below 10.

U.S. Senate Republicans failed to muster enough votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, but reaction was muted in the stock market. Analysts said the expectation for business-friendly legislation out of Washington is all but priced out of equities.

By Saikat Chatterjee

LONDON (Reuters) - The Japanese yen remained on the back foot against high-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar on Friday after dovish comments from major policymakers this week reaffirmed market expectations that interest rates will rise very slowly.

""It is broadly a U.S. dollar-negative market as latest comments from Yellen and others suggest that interest rates will rise very gently and that is supportive for high-yielding currencies for now,"" said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING Bank in London.

The and sterling were among the best performing currencies, especially against the Japanese yen.

Against the yen, the Australian dollar rose 0.23 percent and sterling climbed 0.31 percent, with a relatively upbeat outlook from Fitch Ratings on China also supporting risk sentiment.

Major market gauges of asset volatility, such as the Merrill Lynch Option volatility estimate and VIX ( ), drifted lower on Friday, providing a boost to carry trades.

The U.S. currency's recent advance, notably against the yen , has stalled toward the end of this week after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen curbed some of the monetary tightening expectations that had supported the greenback.

That view was further reinforced by other U.S. policymakers such as Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan on Thursday, though analysts were wary of kicking the dollar lower before U.S. inflation data.

Signs of a pick-up in U.S. inflation could reinforce views that the Fed would hike interest rates again sooner rather than later, which would lift Treasury yields and the dollar.

However, the core consumer price index (CPI) is forecast to have risen only 1.7 percent year-on-year in June after a similar gain in May. On a month-on-month basis, the core CPI is expected to rise 0.2 percent after a 0.1 percent gain the previous month."

Investing.com - Market watchers will be looking ahead to a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping this week amid hopes for a thaw in trade relations, even if it alters expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.

A line-up of Fed speakers, as well as fresh economic data and earnings will also command investors’ attention. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

1. G20 Meeting

Trump announced last week that he would hold an “extended meeting” with Xi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan. The two-day summit gets underway on Friday.

Negotiations between Washington and Beijing broke down in early May after Trump accused China of retreating from previous commitments, causing a market sell-off.

Trump then slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatened to impose tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods, a scenario that Goldman Sachs says could sink equity markets as much as 4%.

""The best the market can expect out of the G20 is a handshake and a commitment to resume talking,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri.

This could be enough to pep up the trade-weary market while anything less could cause the market to nosedive.

2. Fed Speakers

Appearances this week by several Fed policymakers will be closely watched after the U.S. central bank indicated last week that it could cut interest rates to offset global economic uncertainties and subdued inflation.

Fed Chairman will discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, in New York on Tuesday.

New York Fed head John Williams and St Louis Fed President James Bullard are both due to speak the same day. Bullard the Fed’s decision to keep rates on hold last week, instead favoring a quarter percentage point rate cut.

One uncertainty investors face is whether positive Trump-Xi talks could delay a Fed rate cut.

U.S. economic growth, while slowing, is strong enough that ""the Fed can afford to wait a while"" to monitor trade-talk progress, Wells Fargo's Christopher said.

But if investors have to weigh a trade de-escalation with the possibility of fewer-than-hoped-for rate cuts, they will likely recognize ""that a trade deal is a more powerful boost to U.S. growth than Fed cuts,"" said Manulife's Donald.

3. U.S. Economic Data

Some key U.S. economic reports this week include the release of data on Wednesday along with figures on international trade.

Investors will also get an update on the health of the U.S. housing market from reports on , and the .

The week will also bring the final reading on first-quarter gross domestic product, with the consensus forecast for an unrevised reading of .

4. Euro Zone Inflation

Friday’s euro zone will tell whether European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was right to warn that more monetary easing would come unless prices started rising faster.

Inflation has undershot the ECB's near 2% target since 2013. The rate was 1.2% in May. The bank is worried, but it is a dilemma shared by policymakers in many countries, not least the U.S. and Japan.

But Draghi's words have made a mark. A closely-tracked key market inflation gauge -- the five-year, five-year break even forward -- has shot up to 1.3%, having languished at record lows at around 1.12% ahead of Tuesday's speech.

Economists say ""real economy"" indicators, wages, for instance, paint a less pessimistic inflation outlook, raising questions about whether Draghi's reaction to market-based inflation measures is warranted.

5. Earnings to Watch

Homebuilder Lennar (NYSE: ) is due to report before the open on Tuesday, while KB Home (NYSE: ) is set to release its earnings report a day later.

The world’s largest package shipment company, FedEx (NYSE: ) will report Q4 earnings after the close on Tuesday, amid concerns about its business being hit by the lingering China-U.S. trade dispute and slowing global growth.

On Thursday, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: ) is set to report ahead of the open, while sportswear powerhouse Nike (NYSE: ) will report after the close.

Constellation Brands (NYSE: ), the brewer of popular beer brand Corona, is set to report on Friday before the market open.

By Kevin Yao and Ben Blanchard

BEIJING (Reuters) - Both China and the United States should make compromises in trade talks, Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said on Monday, ahead of a much anticipated meeting between the Chinese and U.S. presidents at this week's G20 summit in Japan.

China and the United States last week said they were reviving talks ahead of the meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. Hopes that it will lead to a de-escalation of a trade war that is damaging the global economy has cheered financial markets.

Talks to reach a broad deal broke down last month after U.S. officials accused China of backing away from previously agreed commitments.

Speaking at a news briefing on the G20 summit, Wang, who is also part of the trade negotiating team with the United States, said talks between the two countries' trade teams were underway, though he gave no details.

China's principles are clear, he said - mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and meeting each other halfway.

""Mutual respect means each side must respect the other's sovereignty,"" Wang said.

""Equality and mutual benefit means the consultations have to happen on an equal basis, the agreement to be reached has to be beneficial for both sides,"" he said.

""Meeting each other half way means both sides have to compromise and make concessions, not just one side.""

Wang declined to answer a question about what specific compromises Xi may offer to win a trade deal with Trump.

Both the Chinese and U.S. teams are making preparations for the Xi-Trump meeting, Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Jun told the same briefing, again without offering details.

The two countries are in the middle of a costly trade dispute and have slapped increasingly severe tariffs on each other's imports. China has vowed to not give in on issues of principle nor under U.S. pressure.

Trump has threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion of goods, covering nearly all the remaining Chinese imports into the United States, including consumer products such as cellphones, computers and clothing.

RISING ECONOMIC RISKS

Wang said rising protectionism has dampened global trade and posed a threat to the global economy, while Chen Yulu, a vice governor of China's central bank, warned that global economic and financial risks are rising significantly.

""Signs of reversing monetary policy in major developed countries are becoming more evident,"" Chen told the same briefing.

""At the same time, policy room of many countries after the crisis has been reduced and room for coping with a sharp economic slowdown is limited.""

Last week, the Federal Reserve signaled interest rate cuts beginning as early as July to cope with growing economic risks, which analysts say could increase pressure on China's central bank to ease policy to support the slowing economy.

Another problem is U.S. sanctions on Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co Inc.

Wang said that Xi, when speaking by telephone to Trump last week, had said he hopes the United States can fairly treat Chinese companies.

""We hope that the U.S. can remove certain unilateral measures inappropriately taken against Chinese companies, in the spirit of free trade and the World Trade Organization.""

The Trump administration has accused China of failing to protect intellectual property rights, forced technology transfers and of failing to provide a level playing field for U.S. companies.

China has repeatedly promised to open its market wider to foreign investors and provide them with better services and treatment. China has also denied accusations of failing to protect intellectual property rights or of forcing foreign companies to transfer technology."

By Barani Krishnan

Investing.com - One week ago, we were talking about an Iranian attack on oil tankers. This week’s conversation was dominated by Iran’s downing of a U.S. drone and how President Donald Trump almost retaliated, before standing down in the final minutes. It wouldn’t be too surprising if next week brings another provocative Iran attack of some kind to push the president's button again.

As Olivier Jakob, founder of Swiss energy consultancy PetroMatrix, commented wryly on Friday: “In view of the 2020 elections, President Trump is facing a formidable challenge to address the military provocations of Iran, while avoiding a spike in gasoline prices and a correction of the stock market.”

Trump spoke of “major additional sanctions” against Iran on Saturday, before being holed up at Camp David, to plan his next move against the Islamic Republic. Last week’s 9% jump in U.S. was its biggest since Nov. 2016. 5% weekly gain was the most since the week ended Feb. 15.

On the precious metals front, bullion and futures of gold breached the magical $1,400 mark, hitting near six-year highs. With $1,500 being touted as the next target of gold bugs, some wonder if the yellow metal is better positioned than oil to benefit from the war cries in the Middle East -- as well as the Federal Reserve’s widely-expected rate cut.

Energy Review

There was no weekend short-covering for Iranian risk in the previous week despite the attack on the oil tankers. After this week though, we can't be sure that risk traders can ignore Iran anymore.

The FAA has ordered U.S. airlines to stay clear of the skies of Iran and it is likely that others will follow suit. Military escalation is a weekend risk.

As Jakob of PetroMatrix noted, the U.S. president first called out Iran on making a ""very big mistake” on the drone strike, before pinning blame on an Iranian general ""who was loose and stupid”. ""Trump clearly does not want to engage in a Middle-East war, but it will be harder and harder for the White House to leave the momentum to Iran without any U.S. response.""

Price wise, Brent's backwardation has eased further and WTI is almost out of contango despite high Cushing stocks. Gasoline has also seen strong support after a fire at the PES Philadelphia refinery.

Crude’s rally could extend into the coming week if the U.S. Energy Information Administration issues another strong dataset on crude stockpiles and gasoline demand like in the just-ended week.

Next week will be the final stretch before the July 1-2 meetings of OPEC and its key non-members’ alliance led by Russia. Typically, it is a time when OPEC ministers are most energetic in talking up oil prices. And the debate before them on extending production cuts by another six months will be rich for rhetoric.

Adding to that will be G20 in Osaka, where the star billing is Trump’s highly-anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Oil prices could also see another sharp upside if the U.S. president and his team hold, as he has promised, positive talks with China’s President Xi Jinping and negotiators from Beijing at the G20 meeting next weekend.

All these are hypothetical by the way, as a fall through in any could result in a fresh tumble in oil prices.

Precious Metals Review

Gold has been on an uptrend since the start of June, on speculation of a U.S. interest-rate cut. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve opened the door for a possible rate cut in the future, sending the yield on the benchmark Treasury note below 2% — a key psychological level — for the first time since November 2016.

Investing.com's sees a rate cut coming at the Fed's July 30-31 meeting.

Lower interest rates make safe-haven assets such as gold, which does not yield interest, more attractive while weighing on the U.S. dollar. In Friday’s session, the , measured against a basket of six currencies, hit a three-month low of 95.76.

“Should August gold climb and sustain above $1,420, my work will point to $1,445 to 1,450 as a minimum next target zone thereafter,” said Mike Paulenoff, gold commentator at MPTrader.com. “This will argue that its multi-year upside breakout will continue unabated, perhaps in reaction to the combination of an easier Fed, a weaker USD, rising inflationary expectations and heightened geopolitical tensions,” Paulenoff added.

, reflective of trades in bullion, peaked on Friday at $1,411.72, its highest since Sept. 2013. For the week, spot gold was up 4.4% while for the month, it showed a gain of 9.7%.

for August delivery, traded on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, settled Friday’s trade up $3.20, or 0.2%, at $1,400.10 per ounce. It earlier peaked at $1,414.95, its highest since Oct. 2013, when it rose to nearly $1,454. For the week, August gold was up 4.5%. For the month, it showed a gain of 10%.

Some are now talking of $1,500 levels and beyond if conflict in the Middle East reaches new heights after Thursday’s drone downing by Iran, and signs that the Fed could cut rates by 50 basis points or so by next month itself.

“$1,500 looks like the next big round target,” said Philip Streible, senior market strategist for precious metals at RJO Fututres in Chicago. “Of course, there’s a lot of stop losses out there that need to happen first.”

By Noel Randewich

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended flat on Monday after briefly touching a record high, while Wall Street's ""fear gauge"" dropped to its lowest in over two decades following centrist Emmanuel Macron's victory in the French presidential election.

The CBOE Volatility index ( ) dropped 7.6 percent to 9.77, its lowest since 1993 as investors took comfort from Macron's victory, as well as from strong quarterly reports in recent weeks.

A declining VIX typically indicates a bullish outlook for stocks, but the extreme lows the index has touched are sounding caution for some stock investors.

""It's been here before, but not much lower than this,"" said Donald Selkin, Chief Market Strategist at Newbridge Securities in New York. ""It's signaling that something negative is in the works.""

Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors dipped, with the materials index ( ) down 0.91 percent and energy ( ) rising 0.7 percent on the back of higher oil prices.

The euro hit a six-month high against the dollar after Macron comfortably defeated far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen who had threatened to take France out of the European Union.

By Noel Randewich

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended flat on Monday after briefly touching a record high, while Wall Street's ""fear gauge"" dropped to its lowest in over two decades following centrist Emmanuel Macron's victory in the French presidential election.

The CBOE Volatility index ( ) dropped 7.6 percent to 9.77, its lowest since 1993 as investors took comfort from Macron's victory, as well as from strong quarterly reports in recent weeks.

A declining VIX typically indicates a bullish outlook for stocks, but the extreme lows the index has touched are sounding caution for some stock investors.

""It's been here before, but not much lower than this,"" said Donald Selkin, Chief Market Strategist at Newbridge Securities in New York. ""It's signaling that something negative is in the works.""

Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors dipped, with the materials index ( ) down 0.91 percent and energy ( ) rising 0.7 percent on the back of higher oil prices.

The euro hit a six-month high against the dollar after Macron comfortably defeated far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen who had threatened to take France out of the European Union.

European shares are seen rising after a market holiday on Monday, with spread-betters expecting Britain's to rise 0.3 percent and Germany's 0.2 percent.

On Wall Street on Monday, the gained 0.17 percent and the added 0.73 percent to a record closing high, although the fell 0.13 percent.

Notably, the world's five largest companies by market capitalization -- Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: ) -- all hit intraday or closing highs.

""For those large shares to rally to record highs at the same time, you really need a big amount of money flowing in. It is fair to assume the money that was once staying in the bond markets is now going to hi-tech shares on back of their strong earnings,"" said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) Securities.

The gains in hi-tech shares accelerated after strong earnings from Google, Amazon and Microsoft last week. Apple is due to report its results on Tuesday and Facebook on Wednesday.

In Asia, Samsung Electronics (KS: ) gained as much as 2.0 percent at one point, helping to lift Kospi index 0.7 percent to within reach of its all-time high marked in 2011.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) hit a record high, rising as much as 2.3 percent.

""The memory and the DRAM sector has seen huge consolidation globally. What that has meant is stronger pricing power,"" said Andrew Gillan, head of Asia ex-Japan equities at Henderson Global Investors.

""Earnings have been much stronger than expected in the memory sector.""

In Hong Kong, Tencent gained 1.3 percent at most, hitting record highs.

Strong demand for various products related to the so-called Internet of Things (IoT), in which regular products are connected to networks, are supporting hi-tech demand, said Yukino Yamada, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.

Worries about tensions over the Korean peninsula also eased slightly after U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday opened the door to meeting North Korea's Kim Jong Un, saying he would be honored to meet the young leader under the right circumstances.

The , a barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, closed at its lowest level since Feb 2007, suggesting investors' fears were easing.

In the foreign exchange market, diminishing risk aversion is helping the dollar to gain a foothold at one-month high of 112 yen.

The euro was little moved at $1.0911, stuck in a well-worn range ahead of the second round of the French presidential election on Sunday.

The Australian dollar rose 0.2 percent to $0.7537, as Australia's central bank held rates steady for a ninth straight month in a widely expected decision.

The currency showed limited reaction to a private sector survey that showed growth in Chinese factory activity slowed to its weakest pace in seven months.

The factory survey echoed findings from China's official readings at the weekend which also showed the pace of growth was easing, but still solid. Most analysts attributed the softening to weaker prices for raw materials such as iron ore.

U.S. economic data announced on Monday also fell short of expectations. U.S. factory activity slowed in April, with ISM manufacturing activity index falling to 54.8 from 57.2 in March, an unexpectedly large retreat.

""Given that reading for March was really strong, you can say that it has become 'strong' from 'super-strong',"" said Mitsubishi UFJ's Fujito.

U.S. consumer spending was unchanged in March and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001.

Still economists expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in June as the labor market seems to be tightening.

Money market futures are pricing in about 70 percent chance in June. Virtually no one expects a rate hike in its upcoming meeting on May 2-3.

In the U.S. bond market, the 30-year U.S. Treasuries yield rose above 3 percent for the first time since April 10 after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the government is looking into the issuance of ultra long-term bonds, or those with maturities beyond 30 years.

Fear of more issues in those maturities lifted the yield spread between 10- and 30-year bonds to 0.69 percentage point, its highest since early December.

The 10-year yield stood at 2.327 percent, below a two-week high of 2.350 percent set on April 26.

(Reuters) - Wall Street climbed on Monday, boosted by gains in Apple and other big tech stocks that more than offset weak economic data and pushed the Nasdaq Composite to another record high.

Apple shares (O: ) jumped 2 percent and set a record high, supporting the three major Wall Street indexes. The iPhone maker is due to report its results on Tuesday.

The S&P 500 technology index ( ), the best performing major group this year, gained 0.9 percent, with big tech names including Microsoft (O: ), Alphabet (O: ) and Facebook (O: ) hitting records.

Investors braced for another heavy week of quarterly corporate results in an earnings season that has exceeded expectations.

Overall, profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Market watchers have been looking for results to help justify stock valuations, as the S&P 500 has been trading about 20 percent above its long-term average, based on forward earnings estimates.

""This is shaping up to be the strongest earnings season in several years,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""That has kind of got people gravitating back to equities and gravitating to the equities that are doing well.”

The S&P 500 ( ) gained 4.13 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,388.33 and the Nasdaq Composite ( ) added 44.00 points, or 0.73 percent, to 6,091.60, a record closing high.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) fell 27.05 points, or 0.13 percent, to 20,913.46, after notching its best weekly performance of 2017 last week.

The CBOE Volatility Index ( ), a barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, closed at its lowest level since Feb 2007.

Financials rose 0.6 percent despite volatility caused by President Donald Trump's comments that he was actively considering breaking up big banks.

U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin said that economic growth of 3 percent is achievable in the next two years as the Trump administration sets out to dramatically cut taxes.

Stock gains may have been muted by a series of tepid U.S. economic reports. U.S. factory activity slowed in April, consumer spending was unchanged in March and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001.

Investors girded for more data later in the week, including Friday's employment report, as well as for the two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting starting on Tuesday.

""The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday,"" said Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.32-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.37-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 42 new 52-week highs and 12 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 145 new highs and 55 new lows.

Investing.com - Market watchers will be looking ahead to a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping this week amid hopes for a thaw in trade relations, even if it alters expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.

A line-up of Fed speakers, as well as fresh economic data and earnings will also command investors’ attention. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

1. G20 Meeting

Trump announced last week that he would hold an “extended meeting” with Xi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan. The two-day summit gets underway on Friday.

Negotiations between Washington and Beijing broke down in early May after Trump accused China of retreating from previous commitments, causing a market sell-off.

Trump then slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatened to impose tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods, a scenario that Goldman Sachs says could sink equity markets as much as 4%.

""The best the market can expect out of the G20 is a handshake and a commitment to resume talking,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri.

This could be enough to pep up the trade-weary market while anything less could cause the market to nosedive.

2. Fed Speakers

Appearances this week by several Fed policymakers will be closely watched after the U.S. central bank indicated last week that it could cut interest rates to offset global economic uncertainties and subdued inflation.

Fed Chairman will discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, in New York on Tuesday.

New York Fed head John Williams and St Louis Fed President James Bullard are both due to speak the same day. Bullard the Fed’s decision to keep rates on hold last week, instead favoring a quarter percentage point rate cut.

One uncertainty investors face is whether positive Trump-Xi talks could delay a Fed rate cut.

U.S. economic growth, while slowing, is strong enough that ""the Fed can afford to wait a while"" to monitor trade-talk progress, Wells Fargo's Christopher said.

But if investors have to weigh a trade de-escalation with the possibility of fewer-than-hoped-for rate cuts, they will likely recognize ""that a trade deal is a more powerful boost to U.S. growth than Fed cuts,"" said Manulife's Donald.

3. U.S. Economic Data

Some key U.S. economic reports this week include the release of data on Wednesday along with figures on international trade.

Investors will also get an update on the health of the U.S. housing market from reports on , and the .

The week will also bring the final reading on first-quarter gross domestic product, with the consensus forecast for an unrevised reading of .

4. Euro Zone Inflation

Friday’s euro zone will tell whether European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was right to warn that more monetary easing would come unless prices started rising faster.

Inflation has undershot the ECB's near 2% target since 2013. The rate was 1.2% in May. The bank is worried, but it is a dilemma shared by policymakers in many countries, not least the U.S. and Japan.

But Draghi's words have made a mark. A closely-tracked key market inflation gauge -- the five-year, five-year break even forward -- has shot up to 1.3%, having languished at record lows at around 1.12% ahead of Tuesday's speech.

Economists say ""real economy"" indicators, wages, for instance, paint a less pessimistic inflation outlook, raising questions about whether Draghi's reaction to market-based inflation measures is warranted.

5. Earnings to Watch

Homebuilder Lennar (NYSE: ) is due to report before the open on Tuesday, while KB Home (NYSE: ) is set to release its earnings report a day later.

The world’s largest package shipment company, FedEx (NYSE: ) will report Q4 earnings after the close on Tuesday, amid concerns about its business being hit by the lingering China-U.S. trade dispute and slowing global growth.

On Thursday, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: ) is set to report ahead of the open, while sportswear powerhouse Nike (NYSE: ) will report after the close.

Constellation Brands (NYSE: ), the brewer of popular beer brand Corona, is set to report on Friday before the market open.

By Kevin Yao and Ben Blanchard

BEIJING (Reuters) - Both China and the United States should make compromises in trade talks, Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said on Monday, ahead of a much anticipated meeting between the Chinese and U.S. presidents at this week's G20 summit in Japan.

China and the United States last week said they were reviving talks ahead of the meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. Hopes that it will lead to a de-escalation of a trade war that is damaging the global economy has cheered financial markets.

Talks to reach a broad deal broke down last month after U.S. officials accused China of backing away from previously agreed commitments.

Speaking at a news briefing on the G20 summit, Wang, who is also part of the trade negotiating team with the United States, said talks between the two countries' trade teams were underway, though he gave no details.

China's principles are clear, he said - mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and meeting each other halfway.

""Mutual respect means each side must respect the other's sovereignty,"" Wang said.

""Equality and mutual benefit means the consultations have to happen on an equal basis, the agreement to be reached has to be beneficial for both sides,"" he said.

""Meeting each other half way means both sides have to compromise and make concessions, not just one side.""

Wang declined to answer a question about what specific compromises Xi may offer to win a trade deal with Trump.

Both the Chinese and U.S. teams are making preparations for the Xi-Trump meeting, Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Jun told the same briefing, again without offering details.

The two countries are in the middle of a costly trade dispute and have slapped increasingly severe tariffs on each other's imports. China has vowed to not give in on issues of principle nor under U.S. pressure.

Trump has threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion of goods, covering nearly all the remaining Chinese imports into the United States, including consumer products such as cellphones, computers and clothing.

RISING ECONOMIC RISKS

Wang said rising protectionism has dampened global trade and posed a threat to the global economy, while Chen Yulu, a vice governor of China's central bank, warned that global economic and financial risks are rising significantly.

""Signs of reversing monetary policy in major developed countries are becoming more evident,"" Chen told the same briefing.

""At the same time, policy room of many countries after the crisis has been reduced and room for coping with a sharp economic slowdown is limited.""

Last week, the Federal Reserve signaled interest rate cuts beginning as early as July to cope with growing economic risks, which analysts say could increase pressure on China's central bank to ease policy to support the slowing economy.

Another problem is U.S. sanctions on Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co Inc.

Wang said that Xi, when speaking by telephone to Trump last week, had said he hopes the United States can fairly treat Chinese companies.

""We hope that the U.S. can remove certain unilateral measures inappropriately taken against Chinese companies, in the spirit of free trade and the World Trade Organization.""

The Trump administration has accused China of failing to protect intellectual property rights, forced technology transfers and of failing to provide a level playing field for U.S. companies.

China has repeatedly promised to open its market wider to foreign investors and provide them with better services and treatment. China has also denied accusations of failing to protect intellectual property rights or of forcing foreign companies to transfer technology."

Investing.com - One week ago, we were talking about an Iranian attack on oil tankers. This week’s conversation was dominated by Iran’s downing of a U.S. drone and how President Donald Trump almost retaliated, before standing down in the final minutes. It wouldn’t be too surprising if next week brings another provocative Iran attack of some kind to push the president's button again.

As Olivier Jakob, founder of Swiss energy consultancy PetroMatrix, commented wryly on Friday: “In view of the 2020 elections, President Trump is facing a formidable challenge to address the military provocations of Iran, while avoiding a spike in gasoline prices and a correction of the stock market.”

Trump spoke of “major additional sanctions” against Iran on Saturday, before being holed up at Camp David, to plan his next move against the Islamic Republic. Last week’s 9% jump in U.S. was its biggest since Nov. 2016. 5% weekly gain was the most since the week ended Feb. 15.

On the precious metals front, bullion and futures of gold breached the magical $1,400 mark, hitting near six-year highs. With $1,500 being touted as the next target of gold bugs, some wonder if the yellow metal is better positioned than oil to benefit from the war cries in the Middle East -- as well as the Federal Reserve’s widely-expected rate cut.

Energy Review

There was no weekend short-covering for Iranian risk in the previous week despite the attack on the oil tankers. After this week though, we can't be sure that risk traders can ignore Iran anymore.

The FAA has ordered U.S. airlines to stay clear of the skies of Iran and it is likely that others will follow suit. Military escalation is a weekend risk.

As Jakob of PetroMatrix noted, the U.S. president first called out Iran on making a ""very big mistake” on the drone strike, before pinning blame on an Iranian general ""who was loose and stupid”. ""Trump clearly does not want to engage in a Middle-East war, but it will be harder and harder for the White House to leave the momentum to Iran without any U.S. response.""

Price wise, Brent's backwardation has eased further and WTI is almost out of contango despite high Cushing stocks. Gasoline has also seen strong support after a fire at the PES Philadelphia refinery.

Crude’s rally could extend into the coming week if the U.S. Energy Information Administration issues another strong dataset on crude stockpiles and gasoline demand like in the just-ended week.

Next week will be the final stretch before the July 1-2 meetings of OPEC and its key non-members’ alliance led by Russia. Typically, it is a time when OPEC ministers are most energetic in talking up oil prices. And the debate before them on extending production cuts by another six months will be rich for rhetoric.

Adding to that will be G20 in Osaka, where the star billing is Trump’s highly-anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Oil prices could also see another sharp upside if the U.S. president and his team hold, as he has promised, positive talks with China’s President Xi Jinping and negotiators from Beijing at the G20 meeting next weekend.

All these are hypothetical by the way, as a fall through in any could result in a fresh tumble in oil prices.

Precious Metals Review

Gold has been on an uptrend since the start of June, on speculation of a U.S. interest-rate cut. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve opened the door for a possible rate cut in the future, sending the yield on the benchmark Treasury note below 2% — a key psychological level — for the first time since November 2016.

Investing.com's sees a rate cut coming at the Fed's July 30-31 meeting.

Lower interest rates make safe-haven assets such as gold, which does not yield interest, more attractive while weighing on the U.S. dollar. In Friday’s session, the , measured against a basket of six currencies, hit a three-month low of 95.76.

“Should August gold climb and sustain above $1,420, my work will point to $1,445 to 1,450 as a minimum next target zone thereafter,” said Mike Paulenoff, gold commentator at MPTrader.com. “This will argue that its multi-year upside breakout will continue unabated, perhaps in reaction to the combination of an easier Fed, a weaker USD, rising inflationary expectations and heightened geopolitical tensions,” Paulenoff added.

, reflective of trades in bullion, peaked on Friday at $1,411.72, its highest since Sept. 2013. For the week, spot gold was up 4.4% while for the month, it showed a gain of 9.7%.

for August delivery, traded on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, settled Friday’s trade up $3.20, or 0.2%, at $1,400.10 per ounce. It earlier peaked at $1,414.95, its highest since Oct. 2013, when it rose to nearly $1,454. For the week, August gold was up 4.5%. For the month, it showed a gain of 10%.

Some are now talking of $1,500 levels and beyond if conflict in the Middle East reaches new heights after Thursday’s drone downing by Iran, and signs that the Fed could cut rates by 50 basis points or so by next month itself.

“$1,500 looks like the next big round target,” said Philip Streible, senior market strategist for precious metals at RJO Fututres in Chicago. “Of course, there’s a lot of stop losses out there that need to happen first.”

""(Trump) was tough on businesses that could take advantage of the USA - healthcare, auto makers, any exporter, anyone who did a corporate inversion, pharma, defense contractors and IT suppliers,"" said Brian Battle, Director, Performance Trust Analytics Group in Chicago, saying traders should get used to White House headlines and tweets moving sectors and stocks.

Five of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower. Helping limit losses was a spike in energy stocks ( ), which rose 1.3 percent as crude prices jumped more than 3 percent.

Investing.com - Market watchers will be looking ahead to a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping this week amid hopes for a thaw in trade relations, even if it alters expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.

A line-up of Fed speakers, as well as fresh economic data and earnings will also command investors’ attention. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

1. G20 Meeting

Trump announced last week that he would hold an “extended meeting” with Xi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan. The two-day summit gets underway on Friday.

Negotiations between Washington and Beijing broke down in early May after Trump accused China of retreating from previous commitments, causing a market sell-off.

Trump then slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatened to impose tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods, a scenario that Goldman Sachs says could sink equity markets as much as 4%.

""The best the market can expect out of the G20 is a handshake and a commitment to resume talking,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri.

This could be enough to pep up the trade-weary market while anything less could cause the market to nosedive.

2. Fed Speakers

Appearances this week by several Fed policymakers will be closely watched after the U.S. central bank indicated last week that it could cut interest rates to offset global economic uncertainties and subdued inflation.

Fed Chairman will discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, in New York on Tuesday.

New York Fed head John Williams and St Louis Fed President James Bullard are both due to speak the same day. Bullard the Fed’s decision to keep rates on hold last week, instead favoring a quarter percentage point rate cut.

One uncertainty investors face is whether positive Trump-Xi talks could delay a Fed rate cut.

U.S. economic growth, while slowing, is strong enough that ""the Fed can afford to wait a while"" to monitor trade-talk progress, Wells Fargo's Christopher said.

But if investors have to weigh a trade de-escalation with the possibility of fewer-than-hoped-for rate cuts, they will likely recognize ""that a trade deal is a more powerful boost to U.S. growth than Fed cuts,"" said Manulife's Donald.

3. U.S. Economic Data

Some key U.S. economic reports this week include the release of data on Wednesday along with figures on international trade.

Investors will also get an update on the health of the U.S. housing market from reports on , and the .

The week will also bring the final reading on first-quarter gross domestic product, with the consensus forecast for an unrevised reading of .

4. Euro Zone Inflation

Friday’s euro zone will tell whether European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was right to warn that more monetary easing would come unless prices started rising faster.

Inflation has undershot the ECB's near 2% target since 2013. The rate was 1.2% in May. The bank is worried, but it is a dilemma shared by policymakers in many countries, not least the U.S. and Japan.

But Draghi's words have made a mark. A closely-tracked key market inflation gauge -- the five-year, five-year break even forward -- has shot up to 1.3%, having languished at record lows at around 1.12% ahead of Tuesday's speech.

Economists say ""real economy"" indicators, wages, for instance, paint a less pessimistic inflation outlook, raising questions about whether Draghi's reaction to market-based inflation measures is warranted.

5. Earnings to Watch

Homebuilder Lennar (NYSE: ) is due to report before the open on Tuesday, while KB Home (NYSE: ) is set to release its earnings report a day later.

The world’s largest package shipment company, FedEx (NYSE: ) will report Q4 earnings after the close on Tuesday, amid concerns about its business being hit by the lingering China-U.S. trade dispute and slowing global growth.

On Thursday, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: ) is set to report ahead of the open, while sportswear powerhouse Nike (NYSE: ) will report after the close.

Constellation Brands (NYSE: ), the brewer of popular beer brand Corona, is set to report on Friday before the market open.

By Kevin Yao and Ben Blanchard

BEIJING (Reuters) - Both China and the United States should make compromises in trade talks, Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said on Monday, ahead of a much anticipated meeting between the Chinese and U.S. presidents at this week's G20 summit in Japan.

China and the United States last week said they were reviving talks ahead of the meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. Hopes that it will lead to a de-escalation of a trade war that is damaging the global economy has cheered financial markets.

Talks to reach a broad deal broke down last month after U.S. officials accused China of backing away from previously agreed commitments.

Speaking at a news briefing on the G20 summit, Wang, who is also part of the trade negotiating team with the United States, said talks between the two countries' trade teams were underway, though he gave no details.

China's principles are clear, he said - mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and meeting each other halfway.

""Mutual respect means each side must respect the other's sovereignty,"" Wang said.

""Equality and mutual benefit means the consultations have to happen on an equal basis, the agreement to be reached has to be beneficial for both sides,"" he said.

""Meeting each other half way means both sides have to compromise and make concessions, not just one side.""

Wang declined to answer a question about what specific compromises Xi may offer to win a trade deal with Trump.

Both the Chinese and U.S. teams are making preparations for the Xi-Trump meeting, Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Jun told the same briefing, again without offering details.

The two countries are in the middle of a costly trade dispute and have slapped increasingly severe tariffs on each other's imports. China has vowed to not give in on issues of principle nor under U.S. pressure.

Trump has threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion of goods, covering nearly all the remaining Chinese imports into the United States, including consumer products such as cellphones, computers and clothing.

RISING ECONOMIC RISKS

Wang said rising protectionism has dampened global trade and posed a threat to the global economy, while Chen Yulu, a vice governor of China's central bank, warned that global economic and financial risks are rising significantly.

""Signs of reversing monetary policy in major developed countries are becoming more evident,"" Chen told the same briefing.

""At the same time, policy room of many countries after the crisis has been reduced and room for coping with a sharp economic slowdown is limited.""

Last week, the Federal Reserve signaled interest rate cuts beginning as early as July to cope with growing economic risks, which analysts say could increase pressure on China's central bank to ease policy to support the slowing economy.

Another problem is U.S. sanctions on Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co Inc.

Wang said that Xi, when speaking by telephone to Trump last week, had said he hopes the United States can fairly treat Chinese companies.

""We hope that the U.S. can remove certain unilateral measures inappropriately taken against Chinese companies, in the spirit of free trade and the World Trade Organization.""

The Trump administration has accused China of failing to protect intellectual property rights, forced technology transfers and of failing to provide a level playing field for U.S. companies.

China has repeatedly promised to open its market wider to foreign investors and provide them with better services and treatment. China has also denied accusations of failing to protect intellectual property rights or of forcing foreign companies to transfer technology."

By Barani Krishnan

Investing.com - One week ago, we were talking about an Iranian attack on oil tankers. This week’s conversation was dominated by Iran’s downing of a U.S. drone and how President Donald Trump almost retaliated, before standing down in the final minutes. It wouldn’t be too surprising if next week brings another provocative Iran attack of some kind to push the president's button again.

As Olivier Jakob, founder of Swiss energy consultancy PetroMatrix, commented wryly on Friday: “In view of the 2020 elections, President Trump is facing a formidable challenge to address the military provocations of Iran, while avoiding a spike in gasoline prices and a correction of the stock market.”

Trump spoke of “major additional sanctions” against Iran on Saturday, before being holed up at Camp David, to plan his next move against the Islamic Republic. Last week’s 9% jump in U.S. was its biggest since Nov. 2016. 5% weekly gain was the most since the week ended Feb. 15.

On the precious metals front, bullion and futures of gold breached the magical $1,400 mark, hitting near six-year highs. With $1,500 being touted as the next target of gold bugs, some wonder if the yellow metal is better positioned than oil to benefit from the war cries in the Middle East -- as well as the Federal Reserve’s widely-expected rate cut.

Energy Review

There was no weekend short-covering for Iranian risk in the previous week despite the attack on the oil tankers. After this week though, we can't be sure that risk traders can ignore Iran anymore.

The FAA has ordered U.S. airlines to stay clear of the skies of Iran and it is likely that others will follow suit. Military escalation is a weekend risk.

As Jakob of PetroMatrix noted, the U.S. president first called out Iran on making a ""very big mistake” on the drone strike, before pinning blame on an Iranian general ""who was loose and stupid”. ""Trump clearly does not want to engage in a Middle-East war, but it will be harder and harder for the White House to leave the momentum to Iran without any U.S. response.""

Price wise, Brent's backwardation has eased further and WTI is almost out of contango despite high Cushing stocks. Gasoline has also seen strong support after a fire at the PES Philadelphia refinery.

Crude’s rally could extend into the coming week if the U.S. Energy Information Administration issues another strong dataset on crude stockpiles and gasoline demand like in the just-ended week.

Next week will be the final stretch before the July 1-2 meetings of OPEC and its key non-members’ alliance led by Russia. Typically, it is a time when OPEC ministers are most energetic in talking up oil prices. And the debate before them on extending production cuts by another six months will be rich for rhetoric.

Adding to that will be G20 in Osaka, where the star billing is Trump’s highly-anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Oil prices could also see another sharp upside if the U.S. president and his team hold, as he has promised, positive talks with China’s President Xi Jinping and negotiators from Beijing at the G20 meeting next weekend.

All these are hypothetical by the way, as a fall through in any could result in a fresh tumble in oil prices.

Precious Metals Review

Gold has been on an uptrend since the start of June, on speculation of a U.S. interest-rate cut. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve opened the door for a possible rate cut in the future, sending the yield on the benchmark Treasury note below 2% — a key psychological level — for the first time since November 2016.

Investing.com's sees a rate cut coming at the Fed's July 30-31 meeting.

Lower interest rates make safe-haven assets such as gold, which does not yield interest, more attractive while weighing on the U.S. dollar. In Friday’s session, the , measured against a basket of six currencies, hit a three-month low of 95.76.

“Should August gold climb and sustain above $1,420, my work will point to $1,445 to 1,450 as a minimum next target zone thereafter,” said Mike Paulenoff, gold commentator at MPTrader.com. “This will argue that its multi-year upside breakout will continue unabated, perhaps in reaction to the combination of an easier Fed, a weaker USD, rising inflationary expectations and heightened geopolitical tensions,” Paulenoff added.

, reflective of trades in bullion, peaked on Friday at $1,411.72, its highest since Sept. 2013. For the week, spot gold was up 4.4% while for the month, it showed a gain of 9.7%.

for August delivery, traded on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, settled Friday’s trade up $3.20, or 0.2%, at $1,400.10 per ounce. It earlier peaked at $1,414.95, its highest since Oct. 2013, when it rose to nearly $1,454. For the week, August gold was up 4.5%. For the month, it showed a gain of 10%.

Some are now talking of $1,500 levels and beyond if conflict in the Middle East reaches new heights after Thursday’s drone downing by Iran, and signs that the Fed could cut rates by 50 basis points or so by next month itself.

“$1,500 looks like the next big round target,” said Philip Streible, senior market strategist for precious metals at RJO Fututres in Chicago. “Of course, there’s a lot of stop losses out there that need to happen first.”

(Reuters) - Wall Street dropped on Thursday, weighed down by Apple (NASDAQ: ) as well as selling in Wells Fargo (NYSE: ), Citigroup (NYSE: ) and other major banks as investors worried about the health of Deutsche Bank (DE: ).

The financial index declined 1.49 percent after Bloomberg reported that some hedge funds have withdrawn excess cash and positions held at the German lender.

Growing concerns over the stability of Germany's biggest bank have pushed its shares to record lows and its U.S.-listed stock on Thursday tumbled 6.7 percent.

""This Deutsche Bank story is really casting a very long shadow over equity markets,"" said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York. ""In some respects, it speaks to fears over large money-center banks having serious problems, and the last time we had that conversation was the financial crisis.""

Adding to negative sentiment in the banking sector, Wells Fargo & Co lost 2.07 percent after U.S. lawmakers rebuked CEO John Stumpf over his handling of sales abuses.

Citigroup dropped 2.28 percent and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) fell 1.59 percent.

Apple fell 1.55 percent after Barclays (LON: ) cut its price target. The stock was the biggest drag on Wall Street.

The S&P healthcare index lost 1.84 percent and also weighed heavily on the S&P 500 as shares of Merck (NYSE: ) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) declined.

Among the gainers, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) jumped 6.3 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the chipmaker is in talks to buy NXP Semiconductors. NXP surged 16.88 percent.

Up 5 percent this year, the S&P 500 is trading near 16 times expected earnings, above its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.

""Equity valuations are stretched and priced for perfection,"" said Mike Baele, managing director with the private client reserve group at U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. ""I would not be surprised to see additional volatility.""

The , a gauge of near-term investor anxiety, jumped 14 percent.

The slid 1.07 percent to 18,143.45 points at the close, its sharpest decline since Sept 13.

The S&P 500 lost 0.93 percent to end at 2,151.13 and the dropped 0.93 percent to 5,269.15.

The S&P utilities index, which is sensitive to interest rates, fell 1.45 percent, its fifth day of losses in a row.

Oil prices were up a day after OPEC members agreed to curb production, even as analysts raised questions about the effectiveness of the deal.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.87-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.09-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 35 new lows.

By Richard Leong and Jennifer Ablan

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan's actions last week have given a second wind to an alternative investment strategy that relies on cheap money and low market volatility to produce outsized returns.

Risk parity trades, which involve borrowing to take long positions in both stocks and bonds, have been favored by some big hedge funds and other institutional investors starved for yield by eight years of record low global interest rates.

The funds had a rough 2015 when volatility spiked because of concerns about China's economy and tumbling oil prices, prompting investors to yank more than $2 billion from risk parity portfolios, according to Morningstar. Since January, however, they have bounced back as volatility has fallen, delivering on balance returns more than twice as high as the mid-single-digit total returns from this year's sputtering U.S. equity and fixed-income markets.

For example, Bridgewater Associates, which pioneered risk parity investing two decades ago, has seen its $62 billion All Weather fund post a 13.1 percent return from January through end of August.

That rebound looked under threat, however, in the run-up to the Fed's Sept. 20-21 policy meeting when several policymakers seemed to suggest that a rate rise was in the cards and markets turned choppy.

Yet the Fed not only held fire, but also lowered its forecasts for future policy rates, effectively assuring investors that borrowing costs will stay low for longer. The BOJ, on its part, both affirmed its commitment to more asset purchases and made a new pledge to keep 10-year bond yields near current levels around zero.

The central banks' actions have stoked gains in stocks, junk bonds, emerging market debt and other risky assets that risk parity funds target. They also brought market measures of risks of big swings in the stock and bond markets to their lowest so far this year.

""So I would say if the Fed's latest move dampens cross-asset volatility, then leverage applied via risk parity funds should increase,"" Chintan Kotecha, senior equity derivatives strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE: ) in New York.

WILL FLOWS FOLLOW RETURNS?

The question now is whether investors will regain confidence in the strategy that badly underperformed in 2015 and only started delivering again this year. In 2015, Bridgewater's All Weather, for example, lost 7 percent and another, the AQR Risk Parity Fund , lost 8.1 percent compared with fractionally positive total returns for equities and bonds.

While the case to buy risk-parity funds looks solid, investors have so far remained skeptical.

Morningstar estimates that open-ended funds that employ risk parity have seen about $957 million in net outflows in the first eight months of 2016 to $8.50 billion.

Bridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund company, declined to comment or provide data on investor flows.

The Nasdaq-listed AQR fund with around $442 million in assets is on pace for its 12th straight month of outflows.

It has bled more than $200 million since September 2015, according to Lipper data, despite a total return of 14.2 percent so far this year, including a 2.6 percent bounce last week after the Fed meeting.

A spokesman for AQR declined to comment.

ELECTION LOOMS, BUT LESS FEAR FOR NOW

One possible explanation for investor caution is the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, which has emerged as a source of anxiety.

Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump are in a tight race and its outcome can change Washington's course on spending, trade and taxes. The uncertainty tends to make investors nervous and cut their holdings of stocks and other riskier investments.

""That could add as much volatility as monetary policy,"" said John Bredemus, vice president at Allianz (DE: ) Investment-U.S. in Minneapolis.

For now, though, low volatility prevails in the aftermath of the Fed and BOJ actions.

The CBOE VIX index ( ) known as Wall Street's equity fear gauge, is anchored near its lowest level of the year, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch's MOVE index , which tracks expected bond market volatility three months out, is at its lowest since the end of 2014.

For Bridgewater, AQR fund and their peers, that is a green light to keep betting on a range of risky assets.

""Things are moving in the right direction and that argues for low volatility,"" said Jeff Kravetz, regional investment director at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank in Phoenix."

By Jamie McGeever

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors following the stock market maxim ""Sell in May and go away"" will be ruing that decision this year, after emerging market, Japanese and euro zone equities emerged as the biggest winners in the third quarter.

U.S. equities did less well but were still firmly into gains.

There are signs that the coming quarters may not be as robust, but for the third, the prospect of central banks keeping the stimulus taps open for longer following Britain's shock decision in June to leave the European Union boosted investors' risk appetite and demand for higher-yielding assets like stocks.

The British pound extended its Brexit-driven losses against the dollar, falling more than 3 percent.

Brent crude oil ( ) was the worst performing asset, down more than 7 percent and giving back some of the second quarter's 30 percent gains. This caused commodities in general to fall almost 5 percent ( ).

A Reuters graphic -- http://reut.rs/2doKMRd -- tracking 23 markets across all geographical regions and asset classes shows the divergence between stocks, which were the best performers, and sterling and commodities, which were the worst.

Japanese and emerging market equities added just under 10 percent in the third quarter ( ) ( ), in dollar terms, and euro zone equities rose just under 6 percent ( ).

U.S. stocks were up 3 percent ( )

Investors drew comfort from the perception that markets continue to have the implicit - and increasingly explicit - backing of the world's major central banks.

The Bank of England cut interest rates to a new record low and expanded its dormant quantitative easing bond buying aerogramme in response to the Brexit vote. The Federal Reserve held off U.S. raising rates, the Bank of Japan unveiled new easy policy plans and expectations remained high that the European Central Bank would ease policy further.

SEARCHING FOR YIELD

Sterling fell to its lowest in over 30 years against the dollar shortly after the Brexit vote. It staged a mini revival in August, but this week fell back below $1.30 within sight of the July low just under $1.28 .

The fall in stock market volatility ( ) paved the way for higher equity prices. Bond market volatility was also anchored for most of the three months to September, although bonds struggled to replicate anything like their performance in the preceding quarter.

""The third quarter was remarkably stable, which felt a little unnatural. You can't expect that to continue,"" said Lukas Daalder, chief investment officer at Robeco Investment Solutions, which has 267 billion euros ($299.09 billion)of assets under management.

High yield bonds also performed well, up almost 5 percent over the quarter, as the increasingly difficult 'hunt for yield' forced investors into the less liquid and riskier areas of the investment universe.

The fourth quarter could be a lot more volatile thanks to a deteriorating global economic environment, sluggish corporate earnings and rising political uncertainty around the U.S. presidential election in November.

Underlining that growing sense of unease and caution, HSBC's asset allocation team earlier this month put 17 percent of its portfolio into cash, a high number in its own right but especially high considering it was previously zero.

And according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE: ), investors have poured $158 billion into bond funds this year and pulled $138 billion out of equity funds, a sizeable redemption entirely down to the $143 billion withdrawn from developed market stock funds.

That said, if markets lurch too low too quickly for whatever reason, investors will no doubt be hoping that the familiar cavalry rides to their rescue once again.

""Central banks seem to be losing credibility, but everyone still looks to the central banks. And ultimately, you should never underestimate the power of the central banks, because in the end they can buy everything,"" said Robeco's Daalder."

Investing.com - Market watchers will be looking ahead to a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping this week amid hopes for a thaw in trade relations, even if it alters expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.

A line-up of Fed speakers, as well as fresh economic data and earnings will also command investors’ attention. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

1. G20 Meeting

Trump announced last week that he would hold an “extended meeting” with Xi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan. The two-day summit gets underway on Friday.

Negotiations between Washington and Beijing broke down in early May after Trump accused China of retreating from previous commitments, causing a market sell-off.

Trump then slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatened to impose tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods, a scenario that Goldman Sachs says could sink equity markets as much as 4%.

""The best the market can expect out of the G20 is a handshake and a commitment to resume talking,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri.

This could be enough to pep up the trade-weary market while anything less could cause the market to nosedive.

2. Fed Speakers

Appearances this week by several Fed policymakers will be closely watched after the U.S. central bank indicated last week that it could cut interest rates to offset global economic uncertainties and subdued inflation.

Fed Chairman will discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, in New York on Tuesday.

New York Fed head John Williams and St Louis Fed President James Bullard are both due to speak the same day. Bullard the Fed’s decision to keep rates on hold last week, instead favoring a quarter percentage point rate cut.

One uncertainty investors face is whether positive Trump-Xi talks could delay a Fed rate cut.

U.S. economic growth, while slowing, is strong enough that ""the Fed can afford to wait a while"" to monitor trade-talk progress, Wells Fargo's Christopher said.

But if investors have to weigh a trade de-escalation with the possibility of fewer-than-hoped-for rate cuts, they will likely recognize ""that a trade deal is a more powerful boost to U.S. growth than Fed cuts,"" said Manulife's Donald.

3. U.S. Economic Data

Some key U.S. economic reports this week include the release of data on Wednesday along with figures on international trade.

Investors will also get an update on the health of the U.S. housing market from reports on , and the .

The week will also bring the final reading on first-quarter gross domestic product, with the consensus forecast for an unrevised reading of .

4. Euro Zone Inflation

Friday’s euro zone will tell whether European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was right to warn that more monetary easing would come unless prices started rising faster.

Inflation has undershot the ECB's near 2% target since 2013. The rate was 1.2% in May. The bank is worried, but it is a dilemma shared by policymakers in many countries, not least the U.S. and Japan.

But Draghi's words have made a mark. A closely-tracked key market inflation gauge -- the five-year, five-year break even forward -- has shot up to 1.3%, having languished at record lows at around 1.12% ahead of Tuesday's speech.

Economists say ""real economy"" indicators, wages, for instance, paint a less pessimistic inflation outlook, raising questions about whether Draghi's reaction to market-based inflation measures is warranted.

5. Earnings to Watch

Homebuilder Lennar (NYSE: ) is due to report before the open on Tuesday, while KB Home (NYSE: ) is set to release its earnings report a day later.

The world’s largest package shipment company, FedEx (NYSE: ) will report Q4 earnings after the close on Tuesday, amid concerns about its business being hit by the lingering China-U.S. trade dispute and slowing global growth.

On Thursday, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: ) is set to report ahead of the open, while sportswear powerhouse Nike (NYSE: ) will report after the close.

Constellation Brands (NYSE: ), the brewer of popular beer brand Corona, is set to report on Friday before the market open.

By Kevin Yao and Ben Blanchard

BEIJING (Reuters) - Both China and the United States should make compromises in trade talks, Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said on Monday, ahead of a much anticipated meeting between the Chinese and U.S. presidents at this week's G20 summit in Japan.

China and the United States last week said they were reviving talks ahead of the meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. Hopes that it will lead to a de-escalation of a trade war that is damaging the global economy has cheered financial markets.

Talks to reach a broad deal broke down last month after U.S. officials accused China of backing away from previously agreed commitments.

Speaking at a news briefing on the G20 summit, Wang, who is also part of the trade negotiating team with the United States, said talks between the two countries' trade teams were underway, though he gave no details.

China's principles are clear, he said - mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and meeting each other halfway.

""Mutual respect means each side must respect the other's sovereignty,"" Wang said.

""Equality and mutual benefit means the consultations have to happen on an equal basis, the agreement to be reached has to be beneficial for both sides,"" he said.

""Meeting each other half way means both sides have to compromise and make concessions, not just one side.""

Wang declined to answer a question about what specific compromises Xi may offer to win a trade deal with Trump.

Both the Chinese and U.S. teams are making preparations for the Xi-Trump meeting, Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Jun told the same briefing, again without offering details.

The two countries are in the middle of a costly trade dispute and have slapped increasingly severe tariffs on each other's imports. China has vowed to not give in on issues of principle nor under U.S. pressure.

Trump has threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion of goods, covering nearly all the remaining Chinese imports into the United States, including consumer products such as cellphones, computers and clothing.

RISING ECONOMIC RISKS

Wang said rising protectionism has dampened global trade and posed a threat to the global economy, while Chen Yulu, a vice governor of China's central bank, warned that global economic and financial risks are rising significantly.

""Signs of reversing monetary policy in major developed countries are becoming more evident,"" Chen told the same briefing.

""At the same time, policy room of many countries after the crisis has been reduced and room for coping with a sharp economic slowdown is limited.""

Last week, the Federal Reserve signaled interest rate cuts beginning as early as July to cope with growing economic risks, which analysts say could increase pressure on China's central bank to ease policy to support the slowing economy.

Another problem is U.S. sanctions on Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co Inc.

Wang said that Xi, when speaking by telephone to Trump last week, had said he hopes the United States can fairly treat Chinese companies.

""We hope that the U.S. can remove certain unilateral measures inappropriately taken against Chinese companies, in the spirit of free trade and the World Trade Organization.""

The Trump administration has accused China of failing to protect intellectual property rights, forced technology transfers and of failing to provide a level playing field for U.S. companies.

China has repeatedly promised to open its market wider to foreign investors and provide them with better services and treatment. China has also denied accusations of failing to protect intellectual property rights or of forcing foreign companies to transfer technology."

Investing.com - One week ago, we were talking about an Iranian attack on oil tankers. This week’s conversation was dominated by Iran’s downing of a U.S. drone and how President Donald Trump almost retaliated, before standing down in the final minutes. It wouldn’t be too surprising if next week brings another provocative Iran attack of some kind to push the president's button again.

As Olivier Jakob, founder of Swiss energy consultancy PetroMatrix, commented wryly on Friday: “In view of the 2020 elections, President Trump is facing a formidable challenge to address the military provocations of Iran, while avoiding a spike in gasoline prices and a correction of the stock market.”

Trump spoke of “major additional sanctions” against Iran on Saturday, before being holed up at Camp David, to plan his next move against the Islamic Republic. Last week’s 9% jump in U.S. was its biggest since Nov. 2016. 5% weekly gain was the most since the week ended Feb. 15.

On the precious metals front, bullion and futures of gold breached the magical $1,400 mark, hitting near six-year highs. With $1,500 being touted as the next target of gold bugs, some wonder if the yellow metal is better positioned than oil to benefit from the war cries in the Middle East -- as well as the Federal Reserve’s widely-expected rate cut.

Energy Review

There was no weekend short-covering for Iranian risk in the previous week despite the attack on the oil tankers. After this week though, we can't be sure that risk traders can ignore Iran anymore.

The FAA has ordered U.S. airlines to stay clear of the skies of Iran and it is likely that others will follow suit. Military escalation is a weekend risk.

As Jakob of PetroMatrix noted, the U.S. president first called out Iran on making a ""very big mistake” on the drone strike, before pinning blame on an Iranian general ""who was loose and stupid”. ""Trump clearly does not want to engage in a Middle-East war, but it will be harder and harder for the White House to leave the momentum to Iran without any U.S. response.""

Price wise, Brent's backwardation has eased further and WTI is almost out of contango despite high Cushing stocks. Gasoline has also seen strong support after a fire at the PES Philadelphia refinery.

Crude’s rally could extend into the coming week if the U.S. Energy Information Administration issues another strong dataset on crude stockpiles and gasoline demand like in the just-ended week.

Next week will be the final stretch before the July 1-2 meetings of OPEC and its key non-members’ alliance led by Russia. Typically, it is a time when OPEC ministers are most energetic in talking up oil prices. And the debate before them on extending production cuts by another six months will be rich for rhetoric.

Adding to that will be G20 in Osaka, where the star billing is Trump’s highly-anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Oil prices could also see another sharp upside if the U.S. president and his team hold, as he has promised, positive talks with China’s President Xi Jinping and negotiators from Beijing at the G20 meeting next weekend.

All these are hypothetical by the way, as a fall through in any could result in a fresh tumble in oil prices.

Precious Metals Review

Gold has been on an uptrend since the start of June, on speculation of a U.S. interest-rate cut. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve opened the door for a possible rate cut in the future, sending the yield on the benchmark Treasury note below 2% — a key psychological level — for the first time since November 2016.

Investing.com's sees a rate cut coming at the Fed's July 30-31 meeting.

Lower interest rates make safe-haven assets such as gold, which does not yield interest, more attractive while weighing on the U.S. dollar. In Friday’s session, the , measured against a basket of six currencies, hit a three-month low of 95.76.

“Should August gold climb and sustain above $1,420, my work will point to $1,445 to 1,450 as a minimum next target zone thereafter,” said Mike Paulenoff, gold commentator at MPTrader.com. “This will argue that its multi-year upside breakout will continue unabated, perhaps in reaction to the combination of an easier Fed, a weaker USD, rising inflationary expectations and heightened geopolitical tensions,” Paulenoff added.

, reflective of trades in bullion, peaked on Friday at $1,411.72, its highest since Sept. 2013. For the week, spot gold was up 4.4% while for the month, it showed a gain of 9.7%.

for August delivery, traded on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, settled Friday’s trade up $3.20, or 0.2%, at $1,400.10 per ounce. It earlier peaked at $1,414.95, its highest since Oct. 2013, when it rose to nearly $1,454. For the week, August gold was up 4.5%. For the month, it showed a gain of 10%.

Some are now talking of $1,500 levels and beyond if conflict in the Middle East reaches new heights after Thursday’s drone downing by Iran, and signs that the Fed could cut rates by 50 basis points or so by next month itself.

“$1,500 looks like the next big round target,” said Philip Streible, senior market strategist for precious metals at RJO Fututres in Chicago. “Of course, there’s a lot of stop losses out there that need to happen first.”

By Michelle Price and Swati Pandey

HONG KONG/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Singapore Exchange Ltd (SI: ) said it has raised the amount of cash firms must pledge to cover trading positions due to an expected rise in market volatility linked to Britain's vote on whether to exit the European Union.

Asia's markets will be the first to open in the wake of a landmark referendum on Thursday that will see UK citizens decide whether or not the country should remain a member of the European Union.

Traders expect extreme volatility, especially in currency markets and related currency derivatives contracts, particularly if the ""Leave"" camp wins.

""SGX has been assessing the potential impact of the UK's referendum on the country's EU membership,"" Agnes Koh, Chief Risk Officer, SGX told Reuters.

""Given the potential for increased market volatility, we have taken the precautionary step to introduce higher margins for contracts, including those with material open interest.""

SGX is the first Asian exchange to publicly confirm increasing trading margins, although several others including the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HK: ) and the Australian branch of London Stock Exchange Group-owned LCH have privately told dealers they may also hike margins or require additional intra-day margin calls, traders told Reuters.

SGX, which raised margins on June 17, said it would continue to monitor market developments and may make further adjustments if needed.

Market volatility has already spiked in the run up to the referendum, with the CBOE Volatility index ( ) or VIX up 14 percent on Wednesday alone as polls showed the outcome was too close to call.

The Australian and Japan markets are expected the bear the brunt of the opening Asia-Pacific trading session.

In notices issued to market participants on Thursday afternoon, the Australian Securities Exchange warned of potential additional margin calls on cash and futures products during the Friday trading session. “Participants should be prepared to meet all intra-day margin calls,” the notice added.

A spokeswoman for the Japan Exchange Group, which runs the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Osaka Securities Exchange, said the bourse had not changed margins but was taking measures to ensure smooth trading in anticipation of increased trading volumes, including increasing the number of monitoring staff.

A spokeswoman for LCH, which clears over-the-counter derivatives in Australia, declined to comment on discussions with clients, but said the company's rules allow it to make additional margin calls.

Officials at the Korea and Thailand exchanges said they had no plans to raise margins. HKEX declined to comment.

BE READY

Dealers and traders in Asia Pacific have also taken a series of precautionary measures, including raising the margins they charge clients and stress-testing trading systems, traders told Reuters.

Many staff will be on call and key decision-makers will have to be present on the trading floors.

""We have increased margin requirements for a lot of instruments, all European indices, all FX and precious metals as well,"" Sydney-based CMC Markets chief market strategist Michael McCarthy told Reuters.

""It's an important move from us both in terms of making sure there is enough capital in the trading accounts to protect the traders but also as a signal to them that we're expecting potentially unusual markets and they should be ready for that.""

Many brokers were hit by a sudden lifting of a cap on the Swiss franc against the euro in January 2015 by the Swiss National Bank that saw trading seize up, prices disappear and the currency's value balloon by 40 percent in minutes. That led to a trail of losses and bankruptcies, especially in the retail trading segment.

Pattera Dilokrungthirapop, chairwoman of Association of Thai Securities Companies told Reuters some brokerage firms may raise cash for margin trading on case by case basis to help manage risk.

""Currently, brokers have managed risk quite well and set collateral at about 35-40 percent, which is higher than minimum requirements. I don’t think it should be any problem.""

Major banks around the world are also preparing.

One senior HSBC (L: ) executive said the bank had ramped up staff levels in its global markets business and had extra people on call. An HSBC spokesman said the bank has prepared for any market impact caused by the referendum.

In a notice sent to FX clients on Tuesday, Swiss investment bank UBS warned clients it may fail to execute some orders on its electronic trading platform.

Some money remitters, many of which were burnt by the SNB incident, sat out the market entirely on Thursday.

Azimo, one of the leaders of the new breed of online brokers, said it would make an unprecedented move to halt operations from 6 a.m. on Thursday.

It said it would resume after ""things have settled down on Friday and we can safely trade again."""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Sterling rose and Asian stocks crept higher in cautious trade on Thursday though many investors sought shelter in safe-haven assets such as the yen and government debt as they braced for Britain's vote on its fate in the European Union.

Sterling climbed to a six-month high against the dollar, cementing an impressive 6 percent rise since last week as investors squared short positions ahead of the referendum later in the day.

European stocks are expected to open flat to slightly higher.

While two opinion polls published late on Wednesday, a few hours before voters were due to begin to cast their votes, showed the ""Remain"" camp nudging ahead in the closely divided campaign, trading activity in Asian hours remained erratic, thin and cautious.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ( ) rose 0.2 percent. Many markets in Asia were flat to slightly negative with China's main index among the biggest losers. Japan's Nikkei ( ) was a notable exception with the market up nearly 1 percent.

""Most people at this point expect a rise in the market"" on expectations the vote will favor Britain staying in the EU, said Isao Kubo, an equity strategist at Nissay Asset Management.

""But you never know, and it will be clear by tomorrow so you don't want to take new positions now.""

Various market volatility indicators edged higher in the run-up to the referendum. A volatility gauge for the Hong Kong stock market ( ) has climbed to more than 25 compared with around 18 at the end of December while the more popular VIX index ( ) approached its highest levels seen this year.

Investors remained largely on the sidelines ahead of the referendum as a closely fought vote meant any large positions taken before the outcome was vulnerable to being stopped out. A Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE: ) fund manager poll last week found investors' cash levels at their highest since November 2001.

Some investors such as George Soros expect the value of the British pound to decline by as much as 15 percent from current levels in the event of a British exit from the EU.

On Thursday, sterling was changing hands at $1.4798, after hitting $1.4847, its highest against the dollar in 2016.

The demand for the perceived safe-haven yen remained broadly intact with the dollar adding just 0.2 percent to 104.63 yen , while the euro gained 0.6 percent to 118.67 yen ( ).

""It will be hard for the market to move until the poll results are released. The pound obviously will take center stage. But other European currencies and particularly dollar/yen also bear watching as the pair will reflect swings in risk sentiment,"" said Shin Kadota, chief Japan FX strategist at Barclays (LON: ) in Tokyo.

Before the vote, exchanges and market regulators moved in to tighten risk management systems. Singapore's stock exchange (SI: ) said it has raised the amount of cash firms must pledge to cover trading positions while central banks stood by to pump in emergency cash.

The euro rose 0.4 percent to $1.13430 , while the , which tracks the greenback against a basket of six rival currencies, slipped 0.1 percent to 93.479 ( ).

By Rodrigo Campos

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks dipped in low trading volume on Wednesday, with traders focusing on Thursday's referendum on whether Britain will remain part of the European Union.

Stocks rose early after data showed U.S. home resales rose in May to a more than nine-year high, adding to retail sales and international trade data that painted an upbeat picture of the economy in the second quarter.

But the S&P 500 once more hit a ceiling at the 2,100 level, which has been an area where sellers cluster.

Attention remained on Britain's Thursday vote. A poll published on Wednesday showed a statistical tie, with the 'Leave' camp with 45 percent, just one point ahead of 'Remain,' and 9 percent undecided. Oddsmakers, however, showed a clear advantage for the 'Remain' camp.

""I go with the betting odds, that’s the better indicator,"" said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer, Multi-Asset Strategies and Solutions at Voya Investment Management in New York.

He said despite not holding ""a huge amount of risk"" heading into the vote he is slightly overweight U.S. stocks.

""Earnings revisions are up, oil prices are at a sweet spot, retail sales have been strong; once you get past this unforecastable event (the referendum), people will put cash to work in the U.S. equity market,"" Zemsky said.

Investors also kept an eye on U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's second day of testimony to Congress. She repeated her speech from Tuesday, in which she played down the risk of a recession, but warned that the British vote and a U.S. hiring slowdown posed risks to the economic outlook.

The Dow Jones industrial average ( ) fell 48.9 points, or 0.27 percent, to 17,780.83, the S&P 500 ( ) lost 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,085.45 and the Nasdaq Composite ( ) dropped 10.44 points, or 0.22 percent, to 4,833.32.

The CBOE Volatility Index ( ) closed at 21.17, its highest in four months, indicating traders are more willing to pay for protection against a decline in the S&P 500.

About 6.3 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.8 billion average over the last 20 sessions.

Tesla Motors (O: ) was down 10.5 percent at $196.66 after the Elon Musk-owned electric car maker made an offer to buy his solar installation firm SolarCity (O: ) in a deal worth as much as $2.8 billion. SolarCity was up 3.3 percent at $21.88

The fell 48.90 or 0.27% to 17,780.83, while the Composite index lost 3.45 or 0.17% to 2,085.45, as investors remained cautious ahead of Thursday's historic referendum in the U.K. The , meanwhile, dropped 10.44 or 0.22% to 4,833.32, despite a surge in biotech stocks. On the S&P 500, seven of 10 sectors closed in the red, as stocks in the Energy and Utilities industries lagged. Stocks in the Health Care and Telecommunications sectors led, each gaining more than 0.15% on the session.

Stocks on Wall Street closed lower even as the gained 57 points or 0.9% to 6,284, closing at a two-week high. After the close of trading in the euro area on Wednesday, a poll from Opinium showed that the Exit vote had taken a slight 45-44% lead, while a TNS survey found that the Leave camp jumped in front by a 43-41% margin, with 16% undecided. Still, British sportsbook Ladbrokes (LON: ) placed the probability of Remaining at 73% based on its live odds, down slightly from a 76% chance earlier this week. Notably, it will take the U.K. a minimum of two years to leave the European Union even if the Exit campaign prevails.

As investors remained jittery ahead of the vote, the CBOE's surged above 21.00 at one point in Wednesday's session, before closing at 20.96, near three-month highs. The VIX gained more than three points on the day.

The top performer on the Dow was Merck & Company Inc (NYSE: ), which gained 0.88 or 1.56% to 57.13. It came as the NASDAQ IBB Biotechnology ETF soared as much as 2.7%, after receiving a boost from a Medicare report on Wednesday. Stocks such as Merck moved higher after the report showed that annual Medicare spending didn't trigger the initiation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), a mechanism established in order to control costs. Had Medicare spending exceeded a target growth rate, IPAB would have received the authority to enforce cost cuts in Medicare, potentially leading to sharp reductions in drug spending. The worst performer was McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE: ), which fell 2.03 or 1.66% to 120.60.

The biggest gainer on the NASDAQ was Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: ), which also rose exponentially following the Medicare report. After gaining 2.48 or 2.56% to 99.34, shares in Celgene (NASDAQ: ) are now virtually flat over the last three months. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: ), Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Express Scripts Holding Co (NASDAQ: ) were also among the session's top performers, as investors took a collective sigh of relief once the IPAB trigger was averted.

The worst performer was Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: ), which plummeted 22.97 or 10.46% to 196.64 after reports surfaced that the electric car giant has made a $2.8 billion offer to purchase rooftop solar panel corporation SolarCity Corporation (NASDAQ: ). The acquisition represents a bold attempt by Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla (NASDAQ: ), to rescue the struggling solar energy company, which is saddled with enormous losses and a negative cash flow. Musk also serves as the chairman of Solar City.

Stocks on Wall Street closed lower even as the gained 57 points or 0.9% to 6,284, closing at a two-week high. After the close of trading in the euro area on Wednesday, a poll from Opinium showed that the Exit vote had taken a slight 45-44% lead, while a TNS survey found that the Leave camp jumped in front by a 43-41% margin, with 16% undecided. Still, British sportsbook Ladbrokes (LON: ) placed the probability of Remaining at 73% based on its live odds, down slightly from a 76% chance earlier this week. Notably, it will take the U.K. a minimum of two years to leave the European Union even if the Exit campaign prevails.

As investors remained jittery ahead of the vote, the CBOE's surged above 21.00 at one point in Wednesday's session, before closing at 20.96, near three-month highs. The VIX gained more than three points on the day.

The top performer on the Dow was Merck & Company Inc (NYSE: ), which gained 0.88 or 1.56% to 57.13. It came as the NASDAQ IBB Biotechnology ETF soared as much as 2.7%, after receiving a boost from a Medicare report on Wednesday. Stocks such as Merck moved higher after the report showed that annual Medicare spending didn't trigger the initiation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), a mechanism established in order to control costs. Had Medicare spending exceeded a target growth rate, IPAB would have received the authority to enforce cost cuts in Medicare, potentially leading to sharp reductions in drug spending. The worst performer was McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE: ), which fell 2.03 or 1.66% to 120.60.

The biggest gainer on the NASDAQ was Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: ), which also rose exponentially following the Medicare report. After gaining 2.48 or 2.56% to 99.34, shares in Celgene (NASDAQ: ) are now virtually flat over the last three months. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: ), Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Express Scripts Holding Co (NASDAQ: ) were also among the session's top performers, as investors took a collective sigh of relief once the IPAB trigger was averted.

The worst performer was Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: ), which plummeted 22.97 or 10.46% to 196.64 after reports surfaced that the electric car giant has made a $2.8 billion offer to purchase rooftop solar panel corporation SolarCity Corporation (NASDAQ: ). The acquisition represents a bold attempt by Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla (NASDAQ: ), to rescue the struggling solar energy company, which is saddled with enormous losses and a negative cash flow. Musk also serves as the chairman of Solar City.

By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock markets could see heavy trading and increased volatility as investors position for next week's referendum on whether Britain remains in the European Union.

The June 23 vote could have big implications for the global economy and U.S. stocks. Add to this the annual rebalancing of the Russell indexes, set to go into effect a day after the vote, and it makes for a busy trading week.

Friday could be the busiest trading day of the year as fund managers adjust their positions to that rebalancing.

Should the British vote to leave the EU, U.S. shares could fall sharply, but a ""Remain"" vote won't necessarily result in a big rally, because domestic economic worries may be capping U.S. stocks.

""We are still stuck in the churn,"" said Jeff Morris, Head of U.S. Equities at Standard Life (LON: ) Investments in Boston.

Recent polls show the 'Leave' campaign in the lead and this has weighed on stocks. Campaigning for the referendum was suspended after the murder of lawmaker Jo Cox, a supporter of Britain staying in the EU.

From an economic standpoint, a move by Britain to quit the EU might not have been as potentially troubling for U.S. stocks. But slowing economic growth is also limiting the upside for those shares, said Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve.

""In a low-growth environment, even smaller problems become more pronounced,"" he said.

Some investors are not taking a chance.

""We trimmed overall international exposure in the RidgeWorth Allocation Strategies as a means to reducing overall portfolio risk, until such time as the clouds begin to lift,"" said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta, referring to Brexit worries.

The CBOE Volatility Index ( ), the favored gauge of investor anxiety, hit a 4-month high on Thursday.

""There has been an increase in investors looking for hedges,"" said Stewart Warther, an equity derivatives strategist at BNP Paribas (PA: ).

Implied volatility – an options-based measure of expected swings in shares – gives a good sense of just how much the impending vote is on investors' minds.

Usually, implied volatility tends to gradually slope up the further out in time you go. Investors pay more to be protected against unknown risks down the line.

However, options on S&P 500 index ( ) that expire a day after the vote sport a level of implied volatility that is higher than for options expiring over the next two months, per BNP Paribas data.

And while a lot of the recent selling has been pegged to Brexit risk, there is little expectation for a big relief rally on Wall Street in case Britain chooses to stay.

""It just doesn't seem like there is much incentive to move out on the risk curve,"" said Standard Life's Morris, pointing to recent economic data that suggests that recovery is still somewhat tenuous.

Adding to any potential volatility next week will be the rebalancing of Russell indexes - an annual event that requires index-following fund managers to rebalance their own portfolios.

With this year's rebalance of the and the Russell 1000 indexes set for a day after the Brexit vote, there is added drama. Managers of index-following funds are forced to buy or sell shares to mimic index performance.

Money managers who might have adjusted positions in anticipation of the rebalance will now prefer to wait until after the vote, said Chad Dale, director of index research at ITG in Toronto.

""What that really does is it compresses the indexer trade into the final day."""

By Lewis Krauskopf

(Reuters) - Wall Street closed higher on Thursday as investors digested the implications of a British lawmaker's death on the country's impending referendum on whether to leave the European Union.

The benchmark S&P 500 index snapped a five-day losing streak, after erasing sharp losses earlier in the session.

A British Member of Parliament was shot dead in the street in northern England, causing the temporary suspension of campaigning for next week's referendum on EU membership. The lawmaker, Jo Cox, had been a vocal supporter of Britain remaining in the European Union.

The prospect of Britain's voting to leave in the June 23 referendum has been rattling markets.

""We’re seeing a move in the pound rallying off its lows, the Treasuries coming off of their highs and the stocks coming off of their lows because of that,"" said Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago. ""People are anticipating that this could be one of those things that turns a vote back in favor of remain.""

The Dow Jones industrial average ( ) rose 92.93 points, or 0.53 percent, to 17,733.1, the S&P 500 ( ) gained 6.49 points, or 0.31 percent, to 2,077.99 and the Nasdaq Composite ( ) added 9.98 points, or 0.21 percent, to 4,844.92.

Traders also said covering of short bets after several days of selling could be helping stock prices. Nine of 10 S&P sectors finished higher.

Global stocks have been under duress for a week amid looming uncertainty about the British vote and a focus on central bank policy.

""I believe there is a lot of positioning going on ahead of that event to try to hedge the risk of a negative outcome, and a negative outcome for the markets would be a vote to leave,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina.

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday left interest rates unchanged but signaled it still planned two hikes this year. Fed Chair Janet Yellen acknowledged the need to see clear signs of economic strength before lifting rates.

The S&P is up more than 1 percent for the year, rebounding since mid-February with help from higher oil prices. However, on Thursday energy shares ( ) were the lone declining sector, falling 0.2 percent, as oil slumped to one-month lows.

The CBOE Volatility index ( ), the most notable gauge of Wall Street anxiety, shot up to a 4-month high. After weeks of calm, the index has risen significantly this week.

Merck (N: ) shares rose 2.5 percent, propping up the Dow and the S&P, after positive clinical trial results for cancer drug Keytruda.

Shares of Cavium (O: ) fell 17.5 percent after the chipmaker said it would buy network equipment maker QLogic (O: ) for about $1.36 billion. QLogic shares rose 9.3 percent.

About 7.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 6.8 billion average over the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

NYSE declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.05-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, a 1.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

Investing.com - Market watchers will be looking ahead to a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping this week amid hopes for a thaw in trade relations, even if it alters expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.

A line-up of Fed speakers, as well as fresh economic data and earnings will also command investors’ attention. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

1. G20 Meeting

Trump announced last week that he would hold an “extended meeting” with Xi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan. The two-day summit gets underway on Friday.

Negotiations between Washington and Beijing broke down in early May after Trump accused China of retreating from previous commitments, causing a market sell-off.

Trump then slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatened to impose tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods, a scenario that Goldman Sachs says could sink equity markets as much as 4%.

""The best the market can expect out of the G20 is a handshake and a commitment to resume talking,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri.

This could be enough to pep up the trade-weary market while anything less could cause the market to nosedive.

2. Fed Speakers

Appearances this week by several Fed policymakers will be closely watched after the U.S. central bank indicated last week that it could cut interest rates to offset global economic uncertainties and subdued inflation.

Fed Chairman will discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, in New York on Tuesday.

New York Fed head John Williams and St Louis Fed President James Bullard are both due to speak the same day. Bullard the Fed’s decision to keep rates on hold last week, instead favoring a quarter percentage point rate cut.

One uncertainty investors face is whether positive Trump-Xi talks could delay a Fed rate cut.

U.S. economic growth, while slowing, is strong enough that ""the Fed can afford to wait a while"" to monitor trade-talk progress, Wells Fargo's Christopher said.

But if investors have to weigh a trade de-escalation with the possibility of fewer-than-hoped-for rate cuts, they will likely recognize ""that a trade deal is a more powerful boost to U.S. growth than Fed cuts,"" said Manulife's Donald.

3. U.S. Economic Data

Some key U.S. economic reports this week include the release of data on Wednesday along with figures on international trade.

Investors will also get an update on the health of the U.S. housing market from reports on , and the .

The week will also bring the final reading on first-quarter gross domestic product, with the consensus forecast for an unrevised reading of .

4. Euro Zone Inflation

Friday’s euro zone will tell whether European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was right to warn that more monetary easing would come unless prices started rising faster.

Inflation has undershot the ECB's near 2% target since 2013. The rate was 1.2% in May. The bank is worried, but it is a dilemma shared by policymakers in many countries, not least the U.S. and Japan.

But Draghi's words have made a mark. A closely-tracked key market inflation gauge -- the five-year, five-year break even forward -- has shot up to 1.3%, having languished at record lows at around 1.12% ahead of Tuesday's speech.

Economists say ""real economy"" indicators, wages, for instance, paint a less pessimistic inflation outlook, raising questions about whether Draghi's reaction to market-based inflation measures is warranted.

5. Earnings to Watch

Homebuilder Lennar (NYSE: ) is due to report before the open on Tuesday, while KB Home (NYSE: ) is set to release its earnings report a day later.

The world’s largest package shipment company, FedEx (NYSE: ) will report Q4 earnings after the close on Tuesday, amid concerns about its business being hit by the lingering China-U.S. trade dispute and slowing global growth.

On Thursday, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: ) is set to report ahead of the open, while sportswear powerhouse Nike (NYSE: ) will report after the close.

Constellation Brands (NYSE: ), the brewer of popular beer brand Corona, is set to report on Friday before the market open.

By Kevin Yao and Ben Blanchard

BEIJING (Reuters) - Both China and the United States should make compromises in trade talks, Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said on Monday, ahead of a much anticipated meeting between the Chinese and U.S. presidents at this week's G20 summit in Japan.

China and the United States last week said they were reviving talks ahead of the meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. Hopes that it will lead to a de-escalation of a trade war that is damaging the global economy has cheered financial markets.

Talks to reach a broad deal broke down last month after U.S. officials accused China of backing away from previously agreed commitments.

Speaking at a news briefing on the G20 summit, Wang, who is also part of the trade negotiating team with the United States, said talks between the two countries' trade teams were underway, though he gave no details.

China's principles are clear, he said - mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and meeting each other halfway.

""Mutual respect means each side must respect the other's sovereignty,"" Wang said.

""Equality and mutual benefit means the consultations have to happen on an equal basis, the agreement to be reached has to be beneficial for both sides,"" he said.

""Meeting each other half way means both sides have to compromise and make concessions, not just one side.""

Wang declined to answer a question about what specific compromises Xi may offer to win a trade deal with Trump.

Both the Chinese and U.S. teams are making preparations for the Xi-Trump meeting, Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Jun told the same briefing, again without offering details.

The two countries are in the middle of a costly trade dispute and have slapped increasingly severe tariffs on each other's imports. China has vowed to not give in on issues of principle nor under U.S. pressure.

Trump has threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion of goods, covering nearly all the remaining Chinese imports into the United States, including consumer products such as cellphones, computers and clothing.

RISING ECONOMIC RISKS

Wang said rising protectionism has dampened global trade and posed a threat to the global economy, while Chen Yulu, a vice governor of China's central bank, warned that global economic and financial risks are rising significantly.

""Signs of reversing monetary policy in major developed countries are becoming more evident,"" Chen told the same briefing.

""At the same time, policy room of many countries after the crisis has been reduced and room for coping with a sharp economic slowdown is limited.""

Last week, the Federal Reserve signaled interest rate cuts beginning as early as July to cope with growing economic risks, which analysts say could increase pressure on China's central bank to ease policy to support the slowing economy.

Another problem is U.S. sanctions on Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co Inc.

Wang said that Xi, when speaking by telephone to Trump last week, had said he hopes the United States can fairly treat Chinese companies.

""We hope that the U.S. can remove certain unilateral measures inappropriately taken against Chinese companies, in the spirit of free trade and the World Trade Organization.""

The Trump administration has accused China of failing to protect intellectual property rights, forced technology transfers and of failing to provide a level playing field for U.S. companies.

China has repeatedly promised to open its market wider to foreign investors and provide them with better services and treatment. China has also denied accusations of failing to protect intellectual property rights or of forcing foreign companies to transfer technology."

Investing.com - One week ago, we were talking about an Iranian attack on oil tankers. This week’s conversation was dominated by Iran’s downing of a U.S. drone and how President Donald Trump almost retaliated, before standing down in the final minutes. It wouldn’t be too surprising if next week brings another provocative Iran attack of some kind to push the president's button again.

As Olivier Jakob, founder of Swiss energy consultancy PetroMatrix, commented wryly on Friday: “In view of the 2020 elections, President Trump is facing a formidable challenge to address the military provocations of Iran, while avoiding a spike in gasoline prices and a correction of the stock market.”

Trump spoke of “major additional sanctions” against Iran on Saturday, before being holed up at Camp David, to plan his next move against the Islamic Republic. Last week’s 9% jump in U.S. was its biggest since Nov. 2016. 5% weekly gain was the most since the week ended Feb. 15.

On the precious metals front, bullion and futures of gold breached the magical $1,400 mark, hitting near six-year highs. With $1,500 being touted as the next target of gold bugs, some wonder if the yellow metal is better positioned than oil to benefit from the war cries in the Middle East -- as well as the Federal Reserve’s widely-expected rate cut.

Energy Review

There was no weekend short-covering for Iranian risk in the previous week despite the attack on the oil tankers. After this week though, we can't be sure that risk traders can ignore Iran anymore.

The FAA has ordered U.S. airlines to stay clear of the skies of Iran and it is likely that others will follow suit. Military escalation is a weekend risk.

As Jakob of PetroMatrix noted, the U.S. president first called out Iran on making a ""very big mistake” on the drone strike, before pinning blame on an Iranian general ""who was loose and stupid”. ""Trump clearly does not want to engage in a Middle-East war, but it will be harder and harder for the White House to leave the momentum to Iran without any U.S. response.""

Price wise, Brent's backwardation has eased further and WTI is almost out of contango despite high Cushing stocks. Gasoline has also seen strong support after a fire at the PES Philadelphia refinery.

Crude’s rally could extend into the coming week if the U.S. Energy Information Administration issues another strong dataset on crude stockpiles and gasoline demand like in the just-ended week.

Next week will be the final stretch before the July 1-2 meetings of OPEC and its key non-members’ alliance led by Russia. Typically, it is a time when OPEC ministers are most energetic in talking up oil prices. And the debate before them on extending production cuts by another six months will be rich for rhetoric.

Adding to that will be G20 in Osaka, where the star billing is Trump’s highly-anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Oil prices could also see another sharp upside if the U.S. president and his team hold, as he has promised, positive talks with China’s President Xi Jinping and negotiators from Beijing at the G20 meeting next weekend.

All these are hypothetical by the way, as a fall through in any could result in a fresh tumble in oil prices.

Precious Metals Review

Gold has been on an uptrend since the start of June, on speculation of a U.S. interest-rate cut. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve opened the door for a possible rate cut in the future, sending the yield on the benchmark Treasury note below 2% — a key psychological level — for the first time since November 2016.

Investing.com's sees a rate cut coming at the Fed's July 30-31 meeting.

Lower interest rates make safe-haven assets such as gold, which does not yield interest, more attractive while weighing on the U.S. dollar. In Friday’s session, the , measured against a basket of six currencies, hit a three-month low of 95.76.

“Should August gold climb and sustain above $1,420, my work will point to $1,445 to 1,450 as a minimum next target zone thereafter,” said Mike Paulenoff, gold commentator at MPTrader.com. “This will argue that its multi-year upside breakout will continue unabated, perhaps in reaction to the combination of an easier Fed, a weaker USD, rising inflationary expectations and heightened geopolitical tensions,” Paulenoff added.

, reflective of trades in bullion, peaked on Friday at $1,411.72, its highest since Sept. 2013. For the week, spot gold was up 4.4% while for the month, it showed a gain of 9.7%.

for August delivery, traded on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, settled Friday’s trade up $3.20, or 0.2%, at $1,400.10 per ounce. It earlier peaked at $1,414.95, its highest since Oct. 2013, when it rose to nearly $1,454. For the week, August gold was up 4.5%. For the month, it showed a gain of 10%.

Some are now talking of $1,500 levels and beyond if conflict in the Middle East reaches new heights after Thursday’s drone downing by Iran, and signs that the Fed could cut rates by 50 basis points or so by next month itself.

“$1,500 looks like the next big round target,” said Philip Streible, senior market strategist for precious metals at RJO Fututres in Chicago. “Of course, there’s a lot of stop losses out there that need to happen first.”

Gundlach, chief executive and chief investment officer of DoubleLine Capital, speaks at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York

By Jennifer Ablan

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jeffrey Gundlach, co-founder and chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, said on Wednesday that the major declines in equity and credit markets could suggest that ""margin calls are going on.""

In a telephone interview, Gundlach said he did not expect the high-yield junk bond market to bottom out unless the volatility index rises over 40. ""This is not stopping any time soon,"" Gundlach said. The was up more than 17 percent mid-day Wednesday to 30.56.

""This is a liquidation cycle. All of these things that were so loved are being sold. We have a 'sell the winners mentality',"" Gundlach said. ""Today's action has all the trappings of a liquidation sale.""

Wall Street moved deep into the red in volatile trading, extending this year's selloff as oil prices continued to plummet.

Gundlach explained that tumbling oil prices are a symptom of central bankers' zero interest-rate policies.

""Oil is in massive oversupply due to ZIRP (zero interest-rate policy) induced over-investment,"" he said. ""And crashing oil is not the cause of all this chaos, it is a symptom of global economic weakness. As are all the tumbling risk markets. We have insufficient and dwindling global growth.""

The rout was across the board: all 30 Dow components and all 10 major S&P sectors were in the red, with five down more than 3 percent. The small-cap index fell 2.7 percent. The New York Stock Exchange recorded 1,314 stocks hitting new 52-week lows, while 809 sank to new lows on the Nasdaq, the most on a single day since Aug. 24 for both exchanges.

Gundlach, who had repeatedly warned that the Fed prematurely raised rates in December, said: ""The market is going to humiliate the Fed.""

Gundlach said Fed officials need to soften their rhetoric on hiking rates further. He said he does not think the Fed will be able to raise interest rates eight times over the next two years, as reflected in its 'dot plot.'

Federal Reserve officials publish their forecasts for the central bank's key interest rate on a chart known as the dot plot.

Last year, Gundlach correctly predicted that oil prices would plunge, junk bonds would live up to their name and China's slowing economy would pressure emerging markets. In 2014, Gundlach correctly forecast U.S. Treasury yields would fall, not rise as many others had expected."

(Reuters) - Wall Street moved deep into the red on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 hitting its lowest since February 2014 and extending this year's selloff as oil prices continued to plummet unabated.

The rout was across the board: all 30 Dow components and all 10 major S&P sectors were in the red, with nine down more than 2 percent. The small-cap Russell's 2000 index fell 3.6 percent.

The New York Stock Exchange recorded 1,387 stocks hitting new 52-week lows, while 866 sank to new lows on the Nasdaq, the most on a single day since Aug. 24 for both exchanges.

The beaten-down S&P energy sector's 5 percent fall led the decliners. Exxon (N: ) dropped 4.6 percent and Chevron (N: ) slumped 6.3 percent, its steepest since August 2011.

prices sank 6.6 percent and fell 4.7 percent as a supply glut bumped up against bearish financial news that deepened worries over demand. [O/R]

""For your average investor, when they see today's news, it's going to spur some angst and the big question that everybody has is 'Should I be in cash?',"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.

""The fear is 'Is tomorrow going to bring more selling?'. People are not even thinking about today, they're thinking about tomorrow,"" she said.

Collapsing oil prices and fears of a slowdown in China, the world's second-largest economy and a key market for U.S. companies, has led to the S&P 500 falling 8 percent this year before Wednesday's losses.

At 12:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones industrial average ( ) was down 472.46 points, or 2.95 percent, at 15,543.56.

The S&P 500 ( ) was down 56.31 points, or 2.99 percent, at 1,825.02. The index briefly hit a low of 1,812.29, its lowest since February 2014.

The Nasdaq Composite index ( ) was down 123.36 points, or 2.76 percent, at 4,353.59. The index has closed higher in only two of the 12 trading sessions this year.

The CBOE volatility index ( ), Wall Street's fear gauge, jumped 18 percent to 30.75.

Gold, a traditional safe haven in times of turmoil, rose more than 1 percent. U.S. Treasuries also rallied, with 30-year yields at their lowest in five months.

IBM ( ) fell 5 percent to $121.71 and Goldman Sachs (N: ) dropped 2.5 percent to $152.89 after the Dow components issued disappointing earnings reports.

IBM weighed the most on the Dow, while Apple's (O: ) 2.2 percent drop weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.

Netflix (O: ) was also swept up by the downbeat sentiment, dropping 6 percent to $101.34, despite reporting a better-than-expected growth in its subscriber base.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 3,028 to 114. On the Nasdaq, 2,460 issues fell and 372 advanced.

By Caroline Valetkevitch

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks sank on Wednesday, pushing the S&P 500 to close below 1,900 for the first time since September as investors grew anxious about weak energy prices, U.S. corporate earnings and the global economy.

All 10 S&P 500 sectors ended in the red, led by consumer discretionary shares, the healthcare sector and technology. Selling was broad, with decliners outpacing advancing issues on the NYSE more than 7 to 1 and on the Nasdaq by more than 6 to 1.

All three major indexes are in correction territory. The S&P 500 is now down 11.3 percent below its May 21, 2015, closing lifetime high.

At the same time, the small-cap index dropped 3.3 percent, putting it in bear market territory. The index is down 22 percent from its June 2015 record close.

Stocks had started the day higher but sentiment turned negative when a brief rally in beaten-down oil prices stalled. Growing stockpiles of oil in the United States stoked market fears about demand.

""We've been in capital preservation mode since the year began and as the market has shown an inability to rally with any conviction, that's only increased the level of nervousness,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.

The market has attempted 10 intraday rallies at the outset of 2016, and each one has failed to sustain itself.

The declines ended a two-day rebound for the S&P 500 and resumed the steep selloff that began at the start of the year amid concerns about a slowdown in China and global growth.

The Dow Jones industrial average ( ) closed down 364.81 points, or 2.21 percent, to 16,151.41, the S&P 500 ( ) lost 48.4 points, or 2.5 percent, to 1,890.28 and the Nasdaq Composite ( ) dropped 159.85 points, or 3.41 percent, to 4,526.07.

The CBOE Volatility index ( ), Wall Street's favorite gauge of uncertainty, gained 12.2 percent.

Analysts said nervousness about fourth-quarter earnings added to the bearish tone. CSX (O: ) was down 5.7 percent at $22.35 after the railroad reported a lower quarterly net profit, and said the weak global economy and U.S. industrial markets would weigh on results.

""People are concerned about the health of the economy,"" said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities in New York.

""There's no catalyst to really take it higher. If you start getting bank and other earnings that are really bad, nothing is going to hold.""

S&P 500 earnings are estimated to have fallen 4.8 percent in the fourth quarter from a year ago, in a second straight quarterly profit decline, Thomson Reuters data showed.

JPMorgan Chase (N: ) and Intel (O: ) report results on Thursday. Citigroup (N: ) and Wells Fargo (N: ) are among companies reporting on Friday.

Amazon (O: ) fell 5.8 percent to $581.81 and was among the biggest drags on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.

About 9.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, well above the 7.5 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

By David Gaffen

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors were hoping 2016 would be a fresh start after the U.S. stock market sputtered to wrap up 2015. Instead, what they got was rotten.

Major averages kicked off the year with their worst week in more than four years as investors fled the market, and fear is on the rise that a full-blown bear market may be lurking. While that may be overstated, markets do face an unsightly assortment of obstacles. Here are some of the biggest worries on investors' minds, and some factors that may mitigate the downside risk:

CHINA: The volatility surrounding the world's second-largest economy is a primary concern of investors. Attempts by officials there to tamp the selling in equities and the steady devaluation of the yuan have fed worries about capital flight. Moreover, a weakening in the currency could hurt demand for imports, particularly those sold in dollars like oil.

U.S. exposure to China in terms of gross domestic product is minimal - only about 0.7 percent of overall GDP, according to Citigroup (N: ) strategists - but the knock-on effect for other emerging economies cannot be ignored. Furthermore, Citigroup notes that companies with more than 20 percent of revenues from China, including Apple (O: ), DuPont (N: ), Texas Instruments (O: ) and 30 others, have performed worse than the overall market since the middle of 2015.

THE BULLISH CASE: China's weakened demand cuts the cost of consumer goods and petroleum, and data on driving shows U.S. consumers are spending their savings on gasoline by driving more and spending on entertainment.

INVESTOR SENTIMENT: U.S. stock funds saw their worst week since September as investors pulled more than $12 billion out of equity funds, according to Lipper data. Every sector is down this year.

After just five trading days, more than 40 S&P stocks have already lost at least 10 percent on the year, and sectors normally considered leaders including technology and consumer discretionary are lagging the market.

Furthermore, areas that would be expected to benefit, for instance, from the falling price of oil are struggling as well - the Dow Jones Transportation Average ( ) is off by 7.5 percent in January, trailing the S&P 500's 6 percent drop and even worse than energy's 6.8 percent fall.

""Sentiment is so bad in some corners of the market that transportation stocks can't even rally while one of their main costs deteriorates. It's rare to see new lows in transportation stocks and oil at the same time,"" said Jason Goepfert, president of Sundial Capital Research.

THE BULLISH CASE: Coincident lows in energy and transports have, in the past, happened when the market is notably near a bottoming out.

EARNINGS: Even though the U.S. economy is continuing to grow as evidenced by recent figures on auto sales and jobs growth, albeit at a slowing pace, public company earnings are in recession. Estimates have fallen sharply in recent days, with fourth-quarter results expected to fall by 4.2 percent from the year-earlier period from a 3.7 percent drop anticipated at the beginning of the year.

The forward price-to-earnings ratio, as a result of the market's rapid drop in the last week, has retreated to a more historically average 15.3 level, but stocks often need to become cheaper to entice investors while markets are in a swoon like this. Should profit estimates continue to fall, that will put more pressure on stock price to decline as well.

One side note that is of concern: Citigroup, which reports on Friday, as a result of poor earnings a year ago, is by itself lifting the expected S&P growth rate dramatically, according to Thomson Reuters data. Without Citi, earnings are expected to fall 5.4 percent.

THE BULLISH CASE: Excluding the huge drag exerted by the energy sector, earnings are positive.

DIVERGENT MONETARY POLICY: Strategists interviewed late Friday noted that the Fed's intentions to keep raising rates at a steady clip, compared with the European Central Bank's plans to keep monetary stimulus going, will continue to drive volatility as yields in the U.S. rise and conditions tighten.

The , or VIX, closed at 27.01 on Friday, its highest since late September, and VIX futures show an ongoing inversion, meaning investors expect more near-term gyrations. Richard Bernstein of Richard Bernstein Advisors LLC said Friday that the Fed beginning rate hikes with the United States and world in a profits recession had not happened since 1980-1981.

""We said many months ago it was a recipe for volatility - guess we were right,"" he said.

THE BULLISH CASE: The Fed will continue to keep stimulus largely in place with a slow pace of rate increases and massive balance sheet designed to keep long-term interest rates from rising.

CREDIT SENTIMENT: The BofA/Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Bond Index's spread has continued to widen, reaching 177 basis points over comparable Treasuries on Friday, a few basis points away from levels not seen since 2012. The equity market, for a time, had ignored a similar rise in high yield spreads, but the decline in high-rated credit is a potentially greater problem, because it indicates reduced confidence in funding corporate spending.

Brian Reynolds, strategist at New Albion Partners in New York, says the weakness in credit and in stocks are, in a sense, feeding on each other right now.

""Credit traders continue to watch stocks like a hawk,"" he said. New issuance has remained healthy and should continue. Eight big high-grade bond deals hit the market on Friday. But further weakness in credit could signal more bumps for equities.

THE BULLISH CASE: Reynolds believes demand from pension funds for credit deals will keep these markets active, and even several months of churning in the stock market will not derail credit activity."

By Caroline Valetkevitch

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, ending a volatile week with their worst five-day start to a year ever, as sliding oil prices and lingering worries about the global economy offset upbeat U.S. job growth.

Both the Dow and S&P 500 had their worst five-day starts in history, with the Dow falling 6.2 percent for the week and S&P 500 sliding 6 percent. The Nasdaq was down 7.3 percent this week.

All three indexes saw losses accelerating into the close.

The market had opened higher after data showing U.S. nonfarm payrolls surged in December and the unemployment rate held steady. But that was not enough to keep stocks in positive territory.

Oil prices fell for a fifth day and lost 10 percent for the week, while the S&P energy sector also extended this week's slide, ending the day down 1.3 percent.

Fears of a slowdown in China and the global economy spooked investors this week, creating a turbulent start to the trading year.

""The start of the year is very poor, so that's got investors on the defensive,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (N: ) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.

""In the face of weakening global growth ... it's difficult to find reasons to commit money at this point even if one is bullish,"" he said, adding that he expects stocks to rebound from these oversold conditions next week.

The Dow Jones industrial average ( ) was down 167.65 points, or 1.02 percent, to 16,346.45, the S&P 500 ( ) lost 21.06 points, or 1.08 percent, to 1,922.03 and the Nasdaq Composite ( ) dropped 45.80 points, or 0.98 percent, to 4,643.63.

The CBOE Volatility Index ( ) ended up 8.1 percent Friday at 27.01, its highest close since Sept. 28.

All 10 S&P 500 sectors ended with declines.

Gap (N: ) sank 14.3 percent to $22.91 after the apparel retailer reported a larger-than-expected drop in December same-store sales, while Container Store (N: ) slumped 41.2 percent to $4.22, a day after storage products retailer's fourth-quarter profit forecast missed estimates.

Apple (O: ) shares, however, snapped their three-day losing streak and were up 0.5 percent at $96.96.

Volume was again heavy. About 8.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, well above the 7.3 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks sold off further on Thursday, giving the Dow and S&P 500 their worst four-day starts to a year ever, dragged down by another drop in Chinese equities and oil prices at 12-year lows.

China allowed the biggest fall in its yuan currency in five months, adding to investor fears about the health of its economy, while Shanghai stocks were halted for the second time this week after another steep selloff.

Oil prices ( ) ( ) fell to 12-year lows and prices touched their lowest since 2009, weighing on energy and materials shares. Shares of Freeport McMoran (N: ) dropped 9.1 percent to $5.61. All 10 S&P 500 sectors ended in the red, though, and the Nasdaq Biotech index ( ) fell 4.1 percent.

""People see the weakness in China and in the overall equity market and think there's going to be an impact on corporations here in the United States,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth in New York.

""When you have a market that begins a year with weakness, people are sort of suspect anyway. The economy isn't moving all that well, the outlook is modest at best, and they don't want to wait for the long term. China creates more uncertainty.""

The Dow Jones industrial average ( ) closed down 392.41 points, or 2.32 percent, to 16,514.1, the S&P 500 ( ) had lost 47.17 points, or 2.37 percent, to 1,943.09 and the Nasdaq Composite ( ) had dropped 146.34 points, or 3.03 percent, to 4,689.43.

The Dow has lost 5.2 percent since the end of 2015 in the worst first four trading days since the 30-stock index was created in 1928. The S&P 500 is down 4.9 percent since Dec. 31, its worst four-day opening in its history, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, while the Nasdaq is down 6.4 percent.

Stocks extended declines late in the session, and the CBOE Volatility Index ( ), the market's favored gauge of Wall Street anxiety, ended up 21.4 percent at 24.99, its highest since Sept. 29.

Investors also braced for Friday's U.S. government jobs report, which could show how well-insulated the U.S. economy is from international stresses.

Billionaire investor George Soros, speaking at an economic forum in Sri Lanka, drew similarities between the present environment and the financial crash of 2008. He said global markets were facing a crisis and investors needed to be very cautious, Bloomberg reported.

Apple (O: ), which generates a lot of its business in China and is still the most valuable U.S. company, fell 4.2 percent to $96.45, its lowest since the August market swoon.

Yahoo (O: ) fell 6.2 percent to $30.16 after Business Insider reported the company was working on a plan to cut its workforce by at least 10 percent. Alibaba (N: ), in which Yahoo has a stake, was down 6 percent at $72.72.

Volume has been heavy this week. About 9.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges Thursday, well above the 7.2 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,704 to 415, for a 6.52-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 2,492 issues fell and 390 advanced for a 6.39-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed at their lowest level since early October on Wednesday, weighed down by fresh concerns over China and slower global growth and as energy shares tumbled with oil prices.

Shares of oil majors Exxon (N: ) and Chevron (N: ) fell and the energy index dropped 3.6 percent as oil prices plunged below $35 a barrel.

Apple (O: ) briefly dipped below $100 for the first time in nearly five months following reports of slowing shipments of the company's iPhone 6S and 6S Plus models. The stock, which ended down 2.0 percent at $100.70, was the biggest drag on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.

Against the trend, Netflix (O: ) ended up 9.0 percent after announcing its video streaming service was now live in more than 130 countries.

Weak data from China triggered declines in global equities markets on Monday, with the Dow recording its worst first day of the year since 2008.

The People's Bank of China on Wednesday stepped in again to weaken the yuan, raising fears that the country's economy was even weaker than had been expected.

""The big influence continues to be concerns about what's going on in China,"" said Stephen Massocca, chief investment officer at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco.

""I think there's this theory going around that the global economy is going to slow greatly, driven by a large slowdown in China.""

Adding to investors' nervousness was North Korea's announcement that it had successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. The United States and weapons experts voiced doubt the device was as advanced as claimed.

The Dow Jones industrial average ( ) ended down 252.15 points, or 1.47 percent, to 16,906.51, the S&P 500 ( ) lost 26.45 points, or 1.31 percent, to 1,990.26 and the Nasdaq Composite ( ) dropped 55.67 points, or 1.14 percent, to 4,835.77.

Also in China, a survey showed that the country's services sector expanded at its slowest pace in 17 months in December.

U.S. stocks briefly extended losses in afternoon trading after the Federal Reserve published its minutes from the last policy meeting in December. They showed policymakers decided to raise interest rates last month after almost all of them gained confidence inflation was poised to rise, but some voiced worries inflation could get stuck at dangerously low levels.

The CBOE Volatility Index ( ), the market's favored gauge of Wall Street anxiety, ended up 6.5 percent to 20.59, but well off the high of 23.36 touched on Monday.

""We haven't really seen a major pick-up in volume to the downside. That shows that we are not seeing a lot of people panicking and trying to get out,"" said Scott Fullman, chief strategist at Revere Securities Corp.

U.S. economic data earlier Wednesday showed private employers added 257,000 jobs, ahead of expectations. The U.S. government's non-farm payroll report is due on Friday.

Chipotle (N: ) fell 5.0 percent to $426.67. The company was served with a grand jury subpoena in relation to a criminal investigation into a norovirus contamination at one of its restaurants.

(Reuters) - Wall Street dropped on Thursday, leaving the S&P 500 marginally lower for a year marked by record highs as well as a major selloff.

In a reversal of one of 2015's major trends, oil shares moved higher, with the S&P energy sector up 0.34 percent and alone among gainers.

Much of the blame for this year's underwhelming stock market performance can be laid at the feet of prices, which lost a third of their value during an unprecedented global glut. The energy sector fell 24 percent, its worst annual performance since the global recession.

The S&P 500 hit a record high in May only to slump 11 percent over eight days in August over fears of a China-led global economic slowdown. The spiked to a seven-year high before the market recovered.

On the last trading day of 2015, the S&P 500 fell 0.94 percent to 2,043.94 points, leaving it with a total loss of 0.71 percent for the year. The S&P's total return, including dividends, was about 1.40 percent, according to preliminary data.

""If you went to sleep on Dec. 31, 2014, and woke up today, you'd say what a dull year it's been, and yet in between we've had these wild swings,"" said Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.

""The lesson is that people should watch the extremes. On those big down days, hold your nose and buy - and don't be afraid.""

The lost 2.23 percent for the year, its first annual decline since 2008. The gained 5.73 percent after surpassing levels not seen since the dot-com bubble in 2000.

Eight of the 10 worst performers on the S&P this year were energy companies, led by Chesapeake Energy's 77-percent slump.

The consumer discretionary sector, on the other hand, was the S&P's best performer, rising 8.43 percent thanks to Netflix's 134-percent increase and Amazon's 118-percent surge.

Consumer stocks also took the top three spots on the Dow, led by Nike's 30-percent increase in 2015.

GOOD RIDDANCE!

With much of the day's losses suffered in the last few minutes of trade, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.02 percent to end at 17,425.03. The Nasdaq Composite lost 1.15 percent to 5,007.41.

Nine of the 10 major S&P sectors fell Thursday, led by a 1.43-percent fall in the technology sector.

Many of the risks that worried investors this year will remain front and center in 2016.

""Elevated valuations, modest earnings growth and muted economic activity. Of course, there is the additional variable of rising interest rates,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (N: ) in Boston.

Apple (O: ) dropped 1.92 percent and was the biggest drag on all three indexes. Its stock has been pressured by concerns about potentially weak iPhone sales and ended the year down 4.5 percent, its first annual loss since 2008.

""Apple is caught between being a growth stock and being a value stock and it's caught in the abyss,"" said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Wealth & Investment Management.

Investors next week will watch for a potential ""January effect,"" when stocks that were sold in December for year-end tax purposes bounce back.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.3 billion shares, below the 7.2 billion average over the last 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,882 to 1,163. On the Nasdaq, 1,869 issues fell and 1,022 advanced.

Under the agreement, UnitedHealth Group (N: ) will cover one of the company's genomic profile tests for patients with metastic Stage IV lung cancer. The worst performer was Walt Disney Company (N: ), which fell 1.28 or 1.18% to 106.45, extending losses from Friday's sell-off. Last week, Disney plunged 3.3% in Friday's session after analysts at BTIG downgraded its stock to a sell.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks fell sharply for the second straight day as crude prices hit a fresh six-year low and the yen dragged down the dollar, after the Bank of Japan startled markets on Friday by unexpectedly expanding its easing program at a key policy meeting.

futures closed below $35 a barrel in Friday's session, falling to its lowest closing level in seven years, amid continuing signals of excessive supply on global energy markets. Oil prices have lingered near multi-year lows since OPEC spooked the energy industry last November by leaving its production ceiling above 30 million barrels. They took a further hit earlier this month when the world's largest oil cartel decided to in an effort to defend market share. As a result, crude prices have tumbled nearly 20% since OPEC's decision two weeks ago.

The downturn in oil has weighed heavily on U.S. equities markets in recent sessions.

Quadruple witching hours also typically result in higher than normal volatility in the markets.

The CBOE , a gauge for market volatility, soared 1.79 or 9.29% to 20.70. Volatility has been exceedingly high over the last three sessions, after the Federal Reserve halted a seven-year zero interest rate policy on Wednesday by .

The top performer on the Dow was Caterpillar Inc (N: ), which gained 0.49 or 0.76% to 65.39.

The worst performer was Bank of America Corporation (N: ), which fell 5.53 or 3.80% to 140.03, after reports surfaced that Delta Air Lines Inc (N: ) made a $7.7 million purchase of a used 777 jetliner on Friday.

Investing.com - Market watchers will be looking ahead to a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping this week amid hopes for a thaw in trade relations, even if it alters expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.

A line-up of Fed speakers, as well as fresh economic data and earnings will also command investors’ attention. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

1. G20 Meeting

Trump announced last week that he would hold an “extended meeting” with Xi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan. The two-day summit gets underway on Friday.

Negotiations between Washington and Beijing broke down in early May after Trump accused China of retreating from previous commitments, causing a market sell-off.

Trump then slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatened to impose tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods, a scenario that Goldman Sachs says could sink equity markets as much as 4%.

""The best the market can expect out of the G20 is a handshake and a commitment to resume talking,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri.

This could be enough to pep up the trade-weary market while anything less could cause the market to nosedive.

2. Fed Speakers

Appearances this week by several Fed policymakers will be closely watched after the U.S. central bank indicated last week that it could cut interest rates to offset global economic uncertainties and subdued inflation.

Fed Chairman will discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, in New York on Tuesday.

New York Fed head John Williams and St Louis Fed President James Bullard are both due to speak the same day. Bullard the Fed’s decision to keep rates on hold last week, instead favoring a quarter percentage point rate cut.

One uncertainty investors face is whether positive Trump-Xi talks could delay a Fed rate cut.

U.S. economic growth, while slowing, is strong enough that ""the Fed can afford to wait a while"" to monitor trade-talk progress, Wells Fargo's Christopher said.

But if investors have to weigh a trade de-escalation with the possibility of fewer-than-hoped-for rate cuts, they will likely recognize ""that a trade deal is a more powerful boost to U.S. growth than Fed cuts,"" said Manulife's Donald.

3. U.S. Economic Data

Some key U.S. economic reports this week include the release of data on Wednesday along with figures on international trade.

Investors will also get an update on the health of the U.S. housing market from reports on , and the .

The week will also bring the final reading on first-quarter gross domestic product, with the consensus forecast for an unrevised reading of .

4. Euro Zone Inflation

Friday’s euro zone will tell whether European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was right to warn that more monetary easing would come unless prices started rising faster.

Inflation has undershot the ECB's near 2% target since 2013. The rate was 1.2% in May. The bank is worried, but it is a dilemma shared by policymakers in many countries, not least the U.S. and Japan.

But Draghi's words have made a mark. A closely-tracked key market inflation gauge -- the five-year, five-year break even forward -- has shot up to 1.3%, having languished at record lows at around 1.12% ahead of Tuesday's speech.

Economists say ""real economy"" indicators, wages, for instance, paint a less pessimistic inflation outlook, raising questions about whether Draghi's reaction to market-based inflation measures is warranted.

5. Earnings to Watch

Homebuilder Lennar (NYSE: ) is due to report before the open on Tuesday, while KB Home (NYSE: ) is set to release its earnings report a day later.

The world’s largest package shipment company, FedEx (NYSE: ) will report Q4 earnings after the close on Tuesday, amid concerns about its business being hit by the lingering China-U.S. trade dispute and slowing global growth.

On Thursday, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: ) is set to report ahead of the open, while sportswear powerhouse Nike (NYSE: ) will report after the close.

Constellation Brands (NYSE: ), the brewer of popular beer brand Corona, is set to report on Friday before the market open.

By Kevin Yao and Ben Blanchard

BEIJING (Reuters) - Both China and the United States should make compromises in trade talks, Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said on Monday, ahead of a much anticipated meeting between the Chinese and U.S. presidents at this week's G20 summit in Japan.

China and the United States last week said they were reviving talks ahead of the meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. Hopes that it will lead to a de-escalation of a trade war that is damaging the global economy has cheered financial markets.

Talks to reach a broad deal broke down last month after U.S. officials accused China of backing away from previously agreed commitments.

Speaking at a news briefing on the G20 summit, Wang, who is also part of the trade negotiating team with the United States, said talks between the two countries' trade teams were underway, though he gave no details.

China's principles are clear, he said - mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and meeting each other halfway.

""Mutual respect means each side must respect the other's sovereignty,"" Wang said.

""Equality and mutual benefit means the consultations have to happen on an equal basis, the agreement to be reached has to be beneficial for both sides,"" he said.

""Meeting each other half way means both sides have to compromise and make concessions, not just one side.""

Wang declined to answer a question about what specific compromises Xi may offer to win a trade deal with Trump.

Both the Chinese and U.S. teams are making preparations for the Xi-Trump meeting, Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Jun told the same briefing, again without offering details.

The two countries are in the middle of a costly trade dispute and have slapped increasingly severe tariffs on each other's imports. China has vowed to not give in on issues of principle nor under U.S. pressure.

Trump has threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion of goods, covering nearly all the remaining Chinese imports into the United States, including consumer products such as cellphones, computers and clothing.

RISING ECONOMIC RISKS

Wang said rising protectionism has dampened global trade and posed a threat to the global economy, while Chen Yulu, a vice governor of China's central bank, warned that global economic and financial risks are rising significantly.

""Signs of reversing monetary policy in major developed countries are becoming more evident,"" Chen told the same briefing.

""At the same time, policy room of many countries after the crisis has been reduced and room for coping with a sharp economic slowdown is limited.""

Last week, the Federal Reserve signaled interest rate cuts beginning as early as July to cope with growing economic risks, which analysts say could increase pressure on China's central bank to ease policy to support the slowing economy.

Another problem is U.S. sanctions on Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co Inc.

Wang said that Xi, when speaking by telephone to Trump last week, had said he hopes the United States can fairly treat Chinese companies.

""We hope that the U.S. can remove certain unilateral measures inappropriately taken against Chinese companies, in the spirit of free trade and the World Trade Organization.""

The Trump administration has accused China of failing to protect intellectual property rights, forced technology transfers and of failing to provide a level playing field for U.S. companies.

China has repeatedly promised to open its market wider to foreign investors and provide them with better services and treatment. China has also denied accusations of failing to protect intellectual property rights or of forcing foreign companies to transfer technology."

Investing.com - One week ago, we were talking about an Iranian attack on oil tankers. This week’s conversation was dominated by Iran’s downing of a U.S. drone and how President Donald Trump almost retaliated, before standing down in the final minutes. It wouldn’t be too surprising if next week brings another provocative Iran attack of some kind to push the president's button again.

As Olivier Jakob, founder of Swiss energy consultancy PetroMatrix, commented wryly on Friday: “In view of the 2020 elections, President Trump is facing a formidable challenge to address the military provocations of Iran, while avoiding a spike in gasoline prices and a correction of the stock market.”

Trump spoke of “major additional sanctions” against Iran on Saturday, before being holed up at Camp David, to plan his next move against the Islamic Republic. Last week’s 9% jump in U.S. was its biggest since Nov. 2016. 5% weekly gain was the most since the week ended Feb. 15.

On the precious metals front, bullion and futures of gold breached the magical $1,400 mark, hitting near six-year highs. With $1,500 being touted as the next target of gold bugs, some wonder if the yellow metal is better positioned than oil to benefit from the war cries in the Middle East -- as well as the Federal Reserve’s widely-expected rate cut.

Energy Review

There was no weekend short-covering for Iranian risk in the previous week despite the attack on the oil tankers. After this week though, we can't be sure that risk traders can ignore Iran anymore.

The FAA has ordered U.S. airlines to stay clear of the skies of Iran and it is likely that others will follow suit. Military escalation is a weekend risk.

As Jakob of PetroMatrix noted, the U.S. president first called out Iran on making a ""very big mistake” on the drone strike, before pinning blame on an Iranian general ""who was loose and stupid”. ""Trump clearly does not want to engage in a Middle-East war, but it will be harder and harder for the White House to leave the momentum to Iran without any U.S. response.""

Price wise, Brent's backwardation has eased further and WTI is almost out of contango despite high Cushing stocks. Gasoline has also seen strong support after a fire at the PES Philadelphia refinery.

Crude’s rally could extend into the coming week if the U.S. Energy Information Administration issues another strong dataset on crude stockpiles and gasoline demand like in the just-ended week.

Next week will be the final stretch before the July 1-2 meetings of OPEC and its key non-members’ alliance led by Russia. Typically, it is a time when OPEC ministers are most energetic in talking up oil prices. And the debate before them on extending production cuts by another six months will be rich for rhetoric.

Adding to that will be G20 in Osaka, where the star billing is Trump’s highly-anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Oil prices could also see another sharp upside if the U.S. president and his team hold, as he has promised, positive talks with China’s President Xi Jinping and negotiators from Beijing at the G20 meeting next weekend.

All these are hypothetical by the way, as a fall through in any could result in a fresh tumble in oil prices.

Precious Metals Review

Gold has been on an uptrend since the start of June, on speculation of a U.S. interest-rate cut. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve opened the door for a possible rate cut in the future, sending the yield on the benchmark Treasury note below 2% — a key psychological level — for the first time since November 2016.

Investing.com's sees a rate cut coming at the Fed's July 30-31 meeting.

Lower interest rates make safe-haven assets such as gold, which does not yield interest, more attractive while weighing on the U.S. dollar. In Friday’s session, the , measured against a basket of six currencies, hit a three-month low of 95.76.

“Should August gold climb and sustain above $1,420, my work will point to $1,445 to 1,450 as a minimum next target zone thereafter,” said Mike Paulenoff, gold commentator at MPTrader.com. “This will argue that its multi-year upside breakout will continue unabated, perhaps in reaction to the combination of an easier Fed, a weaker USD, rising inflationary expectations and heightened geopolitical tensions,” Paulenoff added.

, reflective of trades in bullion, peaked on Friday at $1,411.72, its highest since Sept. 2013. For the week, spot gold was up 4.4% while for the month, it showed a gain of 9.7%.

for August delivery, traded on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, settled Friday’s trade up $3.20, or 0.2%, at $1,400.10 per ounce. It earlier peaked at $1,414.95, its highest since Oct. 2013, when it rose to nearly $1,454. For the week, August gold was up 4.5%. For the month, it showed a gain of 10%.

Some are now talking of $1,500 levels and beyond if conflict in the Middle East reaches new heights after Thursday’s drone downing by Iran, and signs that the Fed could cut rates by 50 basis points or so by next month itself.

“$1,500 looks like the next big round target,” said Philip Streible, senior market strategist for precious metals at RJO Fututres in Chicago. “Of course, there’s a lot of stop losses out there that need to happen first.”

By Rodrigo Campos

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 tumbled to a more than six-month low on Thursday, closing in negative territory for the year, on concern a decelerating Chinese economy will translate into slower global growth.

Consumer stocks led the decline on Wall Street with Disney down 6 percent after a brokerage downgrade, while Apple fell 2 percent after a report that overall smartphone sales in China fell in the second quarter.

Concern about the Chinese economy was underscored by a near 8 percent slide in the Shanghai stock index ( ) so far this week and after the Commerce Ministry said Wednesday exports could continue falling in coming months.

""The largest issue is certainly the fact that we don't know how much the Chinese economy is slowing,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.

""That's manifesting itself in lower oil prices,"" he said, pointing to the correlation between stocks and crude futures.

edged higher after earlier hitting its lowest since March 2009, while dropped 2.3 percent to its lowest since January.

The 14-day correlation between the S&P 500 and Brent prices is at a five-month high.

The Dow Jones industrial average ( ) fell 358.04 points, or 2.06 percent, to 16,990.69, the S&P 500 ( ) lost 43.88 points, or 2.11 percent, to 2,035.73 and the Nasdaq Composite ( ) dropped 141.56 points, or 2.82 percent, to 4,877.49.

The drops in the S&P 500 and Dow were the largest daily percentage declines since Feb. 3, 2014, while the Nasdaq fell the most since April 10, 2014.

The S&P 500 is now down 1.1 percent year-to-date. It also traded below its 200-day moving average for the full session, for the first time since last October.

At its session low on Thursday, the S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent from its record intraday high set in late May.

""We've had a lot of things go wrong today both fundamentally and technically. Fundamentally, there's continued concern about global growth slowing and weakness in the price of oil. The market was unable to hold the 200-day moving average from a technical standpoint,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE: ) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama

""For tomorrow, ideally we could see some stabilization and a move back toward the 200-day moving average. The risk is if there's something that investors don't like, it will be really easy to sell going into the weekend.""

The CBOE Volatility index ( ) rose 25.5 percent to close at 19.14, the highest in six weeks, as traders paid more for protection against a further slide in the S&P 500.

Disney (N: ) slumped 6 percent to $100.02 and Time Warner (N: ) fell 5 percent to $73.90, leading a rout in media stocks after a Bernstein downgrade that cited a massive structural upheaval in the industry.

""The pattern didn't change overnight, but it got called by Disney for the first time on their earnings,"" said Hogan.

Disney shares have fallen 17.8 percent since the company reported earnings earlier this month.

Apple (O: ) fell 2.1 percent to $112.65 after a Gartner report said China smartphone sales fell in the second quarter for the first time ever on a quarterly basis. Apple counts China as a key growth market.

One bright spot in tech stocks was NetApp (O: ), up 3.4 percent to $30.78 after the data storage equipment maker's results beat expectations.

NYSE declining issues outnumbered advancers 2,612 to 457, a 5.72-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 2,396 issues fell and 437 advanced, for a 5.48-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.

The S&P 500 had four new 52-week highs and 40 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite had 16 new highs and 208 new lows.

About 8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 6.7 billion daily average so far this month, according to BATS Global Markets data."

By Caroline Valetkevitch

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks rebounded in afternoon trading on Wednesday to end little changed as energy shares and Apple bounced back, offseting continued concerns about a slowdown in China.

The S&P energy index climbed 1.9 percent, the S&P 500's biggest positive, as investors grabbed energy companies shares, encouraged by a bounce up in oil prices from six-year lows hit the previous session. Energy companies have reeled in recent weeks on concerns about China, a top consumer of energy and commodities.

Apple (O: ), for which China is a key market, also reversed course after falling more than 3 percent earlier to its lowest since January. It ended up 1.5 percent at $115.24 and was the biggest positive factor for all three major indexes.

Stocks had tumbled early in the session after China's currency hit a four-year low, its second session of decline.

The Dow moved nearly 300 points from its low of the day to its high before closing flat.

The S&P 500 briefly dipped into negative territory for the year during the session, and traded below its 200-day moving average, before bouncing back. The S&P 500 ended above that technical support level and up for the year so far.

""China is a huge wild card both in terms of the rate at which it's slowing but also how the leadership is handling it,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE: ) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.

""The reversal today is bullish ... at least in the short term.""

Among sectors, financial shares declined the most, with the S&P financial index ( ) down 0.8 percent. China's currency move has created more uncertainty over how soon the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, analysts said.

The Dow Jones industrial average ( ) fell 0.33 points to 17,402.51, the S&P 500 ( ) gained 1.98 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,086.05 and the Nasdaq Composite ( ) added 7.60 points, or 0.15 percent, to 5,044.39.

The CBOE Volatility index ( ), a measure of the premium traders are willing to pay for protection against a drop in the S&P 500, also reversed course. It jumped as much as 18.7 percent to 16.28, its highest in a month, before ending down 0.7 percent.

Alibaba (N: ) was down 5.1 percent at $73.38 after hitting an all-time low of $71.03 after revenue growth slowed at China's biggest e-commerce company. Yahoo (O: ), which has a 15 percent stake in Alibaba, fell 4.3 percent to $34.49.

Macy's (N: ) fell 5.1 percent to $64.11 after it also reported weak quarterly sales.

After the bell, shares of Cisco Systems (O: ) rose 3.7 percent. Results of the network equipment maker beat estimates as demand recovered for its switching equipment and routers.

During the session, NYSE decliners outnumbered advancers by 1.02-to-1; on the Nasdaq, 1,564 issues fell and 1,229 advanced.

The S&P 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and 19 lows; the Nasdaq recorded 30 new highs and 120 lows. About 8.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 7.0 billion daily average so far this month, according to BATS Global Markets."

Investing.com - Market watchers will be looking ahead to a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping this week amid hopes for a thaw in trade relations, even if it alters expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.

A line-up of Fed speakers, as well as fresh economic data and earnings will also command investors’ attention. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

1. G20 Meeting

Trump announced last week that he would hold an “extended meeting” with Xi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan. The two-day summit gets underway on Friday.

Negotiations between Washington and Beijing broke down in early May after Trump accused China of retreating from previous commitments, causing a market sell-off.

Trump then slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatened to impose tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods, a scenario that Goldman Sachs says could sink equity markets as much as 4%.

""The best the market can expect out of the G20 is a handshake and a commitment to resume talking,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri.

This could be enough to pep up the trade-weary market while anything less could cause the market to nosedive.

2. Fed Speakers

Appearances this week by several Fed policymakers will be closely watched after the U.S. central bank indicated last week that it could cut interest rates to offset global economic uncertainties and subdued inflation.

Fed Chairman will discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, in New York on Tuesday.

New York Fed head John Williams and St Louis Fed President James Bullard are both due to speak the same day. Bullard the Fed’s decision to keep rates on hold last week, instead favoring a quarter percentage point rate cut.

One uncertainty investors face is whether positive Trump-Xi talks could delay a Fed rate cut.

U.S. economic growth, while slowing, is strong enough that ""the Fed can afford to wait a while"" to monitor trade-talk progress, Wells Fargo's Christopher said.

But if investors have to weigh a trade de-escalation with the possibility of fewer-than-hoped-for rate cuts, they will likely recognize ""that a trade deal is a more powerful boost to U.S. growth than Fed cuts,"" said Manulife's Donald.

3. U.S. Economic Data

Some key U.S. economic reports this week include the release of data on Wednesday along with figures on international trade.

Investors will also get an update on the health of the U.S. housing market from reports on , and the .

The week will also bring the final reading on first-quarter gross domestic product, with the consensus forecast for an unrevised reading of .

4. Euro Zone Inflation

Friday’s euro zone will tell whether European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was right to warn that more monetary easing would come unless prices started rising faster.

Inflation has undershot the ECB's near 2% target since 2013. The rate was 1.2% in May. The bank is worried, but it is a dilemma shared by policymakers in many countries, not least the U.S. and Japan.

But Draghi's words have made a mark. A closely-tracked key market inflation gauge -- the five-year, five-year break even forward -- has shot up to 1.3%, having languished at record lows at around 1.12% ahead of Tuesday's speech.

Economists say ""real economy"" indicators, wages, for instance, paint a less pessimistic inflation outlook, raising questions about whether Draghi's reaction to market-based inflation measures is warranted.

5. Earnings to Watch

Homebuilder Lennar (NYSE: ) is due to report before the open on Tuesday, while KB Home (NYSE: ) is set to release its earnings report a day later.

The world’s largest package shipment company, FedEx (NYSE: ) will report Q4 earnings after the close on Tuesday, amid concerns about its business being hit by the lingering China-U.S. trade dispute and slowing global growth.

On Thursday, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: ) is set to report ahead of the open, while sportswear powerhouse Nike (NYSE: ) will report after the close.

Constellation Brands (NYSE: ), the brewer of popular beer brand Corona, is set to report on Friday before the market open.

By Kevin Yao and Ben Blanchard

BEIJING (Reuters) - Both China and the United States should make compromises in trade talks, Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said on Monday, ahead of a much anticipated meeting between the Chinese and U.S. presidents at this week's G20 summit in Japan.

China and the United States last week said they were reviving talks ahead of the meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. Hopes that it will lead to a de-escalation of a trade war that is damaging the global economy has cheered financial markets.

Talks to reach a broad deal broke down last month after U.S. officials accused China of backing away from previously agreed commitments.

Speaking at a news briefing on the G20 summit, Wang, who is also part of the trade negotiating team with the United States, said talks between the two countries' trade teams were underway, though he gave no details.

China's principles are clear, he said - mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and meeting each other halfway.

""Mutual respect means each side must respect the other's sovereignty,"" Wang said.

""Equality and mutual benefit means the consultations have to happen on an equal basis, the agreement to be reached has to be beneficial for both sides,"" he said.

""Meeting each other half way means both sides have to compromise and make concessions, not just one side.""

Wang declined to answer a question about what specific compromises Xi may offer to win a trade deal with Trump.

Both the Chinese and U.S. teams are making preparations for the Xi-Trump meeting, Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Jun told the same briefing, again without offering details.

The two countries are in the middle of a costly trade dispute and have slapped increasingly severe tariffs on each other's imports. China has vowed to not give in on issues of principle nor under U.S. pressure.

Trump has threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion of goods, covering nearly all the remaining Chinese imports into the United States, including consumer products such as cellphones, computers and clothing.

RISING ECONOMIC RISKS

Wang said rising protectionism has dampened global trade and posed a threat to the global economy, while Chen Yulu, a vice governor of China's central bank, warned that global economic and financial risks are rising significantly.

""Signs of reversing monetary policy in major developed countries are becoming more evident,"" Chen told the same briefing.

""At the same time, policy room of many countries after the crisis has been reduced and room for coping with a sharp economic slowdown is limited.""

Last week, the Federal Reserve signaled interest rate cuts beginning as early as July to cope with growing economic risks, which analysts say could increase pressure on China's central bank to ease policy to support the slowing economy.

Another problem is U.S. sanctions on Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co Inc.

Wang said that Xi, when speaking by telephone to Trump last week, had said he hopes the United States can fairly treat Chinese companies.

""We hope that the U.S. can remove certain unilateral measures inappropriately taken against Chinese companies, in the spirit of free trade and the World Trade Organization.""

The Trump administration has accused China of failing to protect intellectual property rights, forced technology transfers and of failing to provide a level playing field for U.S. companies.

China has repeatedly promised to open its market wider to foreign investors and provide them with better services and treatment. China has also denied accusations of failing to protect intellectual property rights or of forcing foreign companies to transfer technology."

Investing.com - One week ago, we were talking about an Iranian attack on oil tankers. This week’s conversation was dominated by Iran’s downing of a U.S. drone and how President Donald Trump almost retaliated, before standing down in the final minutes. It wouldn’t be too surprising if next week brings another provocative Iran attack of some kind to push the president's button again.

As Olivier Jakob, founder of Swiss energy consultancy PetroMatrix, commented wryly on Friday: “In view of the 2020 elections, President Trump is facing a formidable challenge to address the military provocations of Iran, while avoiding a spike in gasoline prices and a correction of the stock market.”

Trump spoke of “major additional sanctions” against Iran on Saturday, before being holed up at Camp David, to plan his next move against the Islamic Republic. Last week’s 9% jump in U.S. was its biggest since Nov. 2016. 5% weekly gain was the most since the week ended Feb. 15.

On the precious metals front, bullion and futures of gold breached the magical $1,400 mark, hitting near six-year highs. With $1,500 being touted as the next target of gold bugs, some wonder if the yellow metal is better positioned than oil to benefit from the war cries in the Middle East -- as well as the Federal Reserve’s widely-expected rate cut.

Energy Review

There was no weekend short-covering for Iranian risk in the previous week despite the attack on the oil tankers. After this week though, we can't be sure that risk traders can ignore Iran anymore.

The FAA has ordered U.S. airlines to stay clear of the skies of Iran and it is likely that others will follow suit. Military escalation is a weekend risk.

As Jakob of PetroMatrix noted, the U.S. president first called out Iran on making a ""very big mistake” on the drone strike, before pinning blame on an Iranian general ""who was loose and stupid”. ""Trump clearly does not want to engage in a Middle-East war, but it will be harder and harder for the White House to leave the momentum to Iran without any U.S. response.""

Price wise, Brent's backwardation has eased further and WTI is almost out of contango despite high Cushing stocks. Gasoline has also seen strong support after a fire at the PES Philadelphia refinery.

Crude’s rally could extend into the coming week if the U.S. Energy Information Administration issues another strong dataset on crude stockpiles and gasoline demand like in the just-ended week.

Next week will be the final stretch before the July 1-2 meetings of OPEC and its key non-members’ alliance led by Russia. Typically, it is a time when OPEC ministers are most energetic in talking up oil prices. And the debate before them on extending production cuts by another six months will be rich for rhetoric.

Adding to that will be G20 in Osaka, where the star billing is Trump’s highly-anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Oil prices could also see another sharp upside if the U.S. president and his team hold, as he has promised, positive talks with China’s President Xi Jinping and negotiators from Beijing at the G20 meeting next weekend.

All these are hypothetical by the way, as a fall through in any could result in a fresh tumble in oil prices.

Precious Metals Review

Gold has been on an uptrend since the start of June, on speculation of a U.S. interest-rate cut. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve opened the door for a possible rate cut in the future, sending the yield on the benchmark Treasury note below 2% — a key psychological level — for the first time since November 2016.

Investing.com's sees a rate cut coming at the Fed's July 30-31 meeting.

Lower interest rates make safe-haven assets such as gold, which does not yield interest, more attractive while weighing on the U.S. dollar. In Friday’s session, the , measured against a basket of six currencies, hit a three-month low of 95.76.

“Should August gold climb and sustain above $1,420, my work will point to $1,445 to 1,450 as a minimum next target zone thereafter,” said Mike Paulenoff, gold commentator at MPTrader.com. “This will argue that its multi-year upside breakout will continue unabated, perhaps in reaction to the combination of an easier Fed, a weaker USD, rising inflationary expectations and heightened geopolitical tensions,” Paulenoff added.

, reflective of trades in bullion, peaked on Friday at $1,411.72, its highest since Sept. 2013. For the week, spot gold was up 4.4% while for the month, it showed a gain of 9.7%.

for August delivery, traded on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, settled Friday’s trade up $3.20, or 0.2%, at $1,400.10 per ounce. It earlier peaked at $1,414.95, its highest since Oct. 2013, when it rose to nearly $1,454. For the week, August gold was up 4.5%. For the month, it showed a gain of 10%.

Some are now talking of $1,500 levels and beyond if conflict in the Middle East reaches new heights after Thursday’s drone downing by Iran, and signs that the Fed could cut rates by 50 basis points or so by next month itself.

“$1,500 looks like the next big round target,” said Philip Streible, senior market strategist for precious metals at RJO Fututres in Chicago. “Of course, there’s a lot of stop losses out there that need to happen first.”

By Caroline Valetkevitch

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street investors may find little reason to make big moves next week as they await monthly U.S. jobs data and any news that could change expectations for the first interest rate hike in almost a decade.

The Labor Department report is due on Friday, when the stock market will be closed for Good Friday, leaving investors unable to trade on the data until the following week.

In the meantime, investors will continue adjusting to lowered earnings forecasts for the first quarter and the uncertain direction of the dollar.

Stocks have trended downward since rallying on the Federal Reserve's March 18 statement, in which it suggested a less-aggressive approach to raising interest rates than investors had expected.

""We're in this sort of information void right now,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, which manages about $67 billion in assets. ""We don't yet have the earnings season and there's almost nothing so significant as to rattle the equities market right now, so we're sort of in a pause.""

Uncertainty surrounding the timing of the Fed's rate move has been one of the key factors for the market, creating more volatility and putting greater emphasis on economic data that could sway the Fed's outlook.

Adding to concerns about the Fed has been a dramatic rise in the U.S. dollar, which has weighed on U.S. stocks because of increased worries about earnings for U.S. multinational companies. The earnings season officially kicks off April 8, when Alcoa (N: ) reports.

Up-and-down moves have left the S&P 500 ( ) virtually flat compared with the end of 2014.

""It's like the market is trying figure out what that next driver will be to hang its hat on,"" said Joe Bell, senior equity analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati.

A recent Reuters poll shows the majority of Wall Street's top banks see the Fed holding off until at least September before raising rates. But the jobs report could shift those views again, especially since February marked the 12th straight month that employment gains have been above 200,000, the longest such run since 1994.

While Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index ( ), is above levels seen for most of the last two years, it remains well below its October high.

That indicates institutional investors are not overly concerned about a big downward move at the moment, according to Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab (NYSE: ) in Austin, Texas.

History suggests a tighter Fed policy may not result in a pickup in volatility, according to Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist for RBC Capital Markets in New York. The VIX drifted lower as the last rate hike cycle in 2006 began, he noted.

""It's because when the Fed is tightening, it's usually a sign - especially when they start - that things are getting pretty good,"" Golub said."
